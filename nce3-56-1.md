Lesson Fifty-six   Part One   Our neighbour, the river

Why had the neighbours left their farm?

The river, which forms the eastern boundary of our farm, has always played an important part in our lives.
Without it, we could not make a living.
There is only enough spring water to _supply_ the needs of the house, so we have to pump from the river for farm use. 
We tell the river all our secrets.
We know instinctively, just as _beekeepers_ with their _bees_, that misfortune might overtake us, if the important _events_ of our lives were not _related_ to it.
We have special river birthday parties in the summer.
Sometimes we go upstream to a _favourite backwater_, sometimes we have our party at a boathouse, which _a predecessor of ours_ at the farm, built in the _meadow_ _hard_ by the deepest pool for swimming and diving.
In the heat wave, we _choose_ a midnight birthday party, and that is the most exciting _of all_.
