Lesson Twenty-one  Part one  William S Hart and the early western film

How did William _Hart's_ _childhood_ _prepare him for his acting role_ in western films?  

William. S. Hart was, perhaps, the greatest _of all Western stars_ ,for unlike _Gary Copper_ and _John Wayne_, he appeared in nothing but Westerns.
From 1914 to 1924, he was _supreme_ and _unchallenged_.
It was Hart _who_ created the basic formula of the Western film, and devised the _protagonist_ he played in every film he made, the good-bad man, the _accidental-noble_ _outlaw_ , or the _honest_ but _framed_ cowboy, or the _sheriff_ made _suspect_ _by_ _vicious_ _gossip_, in short, the individual in _conflict_ himself and _his frontier_ _environment_.
Unlike most of his _contemporaries_ in Hollywood, Hart actually knew something of the old Western.
He had lived in _it_ as a child when it was already disappearing, and his hero was firmly rooted in his memories and _experinces_, and _in both_ the _history_ and the _mythology_ of the _vanished_ frontier.
