Lesson Eighteen  Part one  porpoises

What would you _think_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

Porposes and sharks are natural enemies.
It is possible that _upon such an_ occasion, _a battle ensued_ ,with shark being driven away or killed.
Whether it be _bird_, fish or beast, the porpoises is _intried_ with anything that is life.
They are confidently _after_ the tortoises, who peacefully _submit_ all sorts of _indigneties_.
One young _caf_ especially enjoyed _rising_ a tortoise to the surface with his _snalt_, and then _shaving him close to_ the tank _like a acoplane_.

Almost any day, a young porpoise may be seen trying to turn the three hundred pounds _sea tortoise_ over by _sticking_ his snalt under the _agevis_ shelf ,and pushing up for dear life.
