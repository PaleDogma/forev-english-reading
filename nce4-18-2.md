Lesson Eighteen  Part one  porpoises

What would you _say_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

Porposes and sharks are natural enemies.
It is possible that _upon such an_ occasion, _a battle ensued_ ,with shark being driven away or killed.
Whether it be _bird_, fish or beast, the porpoises is _intrigud_ with anything that is _alive_.
They are _constantly_ _after_ the _turtles_, who peacefully _submit_ all sorts of _indignities_.
One young _calf_ especially enjoyed _raising_ a _turtle_ to the surface with his _snout__, and then _shoving him across_ the tank _like a aqueaplane_.

Almost any day, a young porpoise may be seen trying to turn a three hundred pound _sea turtle_ over by _sticking_ his _snout_ under the _edge of shell_  ,and pushing up for dear life.
