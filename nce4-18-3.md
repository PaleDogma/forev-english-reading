Lesson Eighteen  Part three  porpoises

What would you _say_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

This is not easy and may require two porpoise working together.
In another game, as the _turtle_ swims across the _oceanarium_, the first porpoises _swoops_ down from above and _butts_ his shelf with his _belly_.
This knocked the _turtle_ several feet.
He no sooner recovers its _equilibrium_ than another porpoise comes along and hits him another crack.
Eventually, the torroise has been  _butted_  all the way down to the _floor_ of tank.
He is now _satisfied_ merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so, a porpoise knocks him flat.
The porpoise at last _gives up by pulling his feet under his shelf_ and the game is over.
