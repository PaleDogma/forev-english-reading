Lesson Eighteen  Part one  porpoises

What would you _think_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

This is not easy and may require two porpoise working together.
In another game, as the tortoise swimming across the _ocean_ area, the first porpoises _sups_ down from above and _bats_ his shelf with his bully.
This knocked the tortoise several feet.
He no sooner recovers its _equal_ _liblunt_, than another porpoise comes along and hits him another crack.
Eventually, the torroise has been  _batted_  all the way down to the _floor_ of tank.
He is now _satisfied_ merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so, a porpoise knocks him flat.
The porpoise at last _gives up by his feet under his shelf_ and the game is over.
