Lesson Forty-Six  Part Two    Do it Yourself

Do the writer repair his _lawn_ _mower_ in the end,why? why not?

Even men who can hardly drive a _nail_ in straight,are supposed to be _born_  electricians,carpenters,plumbers and mechanics.
When lights fuse,funiture gets _rickety_, _pipes_ get _clogged_ ,or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some women assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. 
The worst thing about "do it yourself" game  is that sometimes, even men _live under_ the _delusion_ that they can do anything, even,when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. 
It is a question of pride as much as anything else.
Last spring,my wife suggested that I called in a man to look at our lawn mower.
It had broken down the previous summer,_and though I promised_ to repair it,I have never got round to it.
I would not hear of the suggestion and said I would fix it myself.
One Saturday afternoon,I hauled the machine into the garden,and had a close look at it.
As far as I could see,it needed only a _minor_ _ajustment_,a _turn of_ _a screw_ here,a _little_ _tightening_ up there, a _drop_ _of oil_ ,and it would be as good as new.
