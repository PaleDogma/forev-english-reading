Lesson Nineteen  Part three  The stuff of dreams

What is going on when a person _experiences rapid eye-movements_ during sleep?


He showed that the _average_ _individual's_ sleep _cycle_ is _punctuated_ with _peculiar_ _bursts_ of eyes-movements, some _drifting_ and _slow_ , others _jerky and rapid_.
People _woken_ during this _period of_ eye movements generally reporting that they had been dreaming.
When woken at other times, they reported no dreams.
If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movements sleep for several _nights on end_ , and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time ,but when they were not _exhibiting_ eye movements, the first group began to show personality _disorders_, while the others seemed more or less _uneffected_.
The _implications_ of all this, were that was not the _dusturbance_ of sleep that mattered, but _disturbance_ of dreaming.
