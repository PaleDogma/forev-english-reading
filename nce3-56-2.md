Lesson Fifty-six   Part Two   Our neighbour,the river

Why had the neighbours left their farm?

We welcome the seasons by the riverside, _crowning_ the _youngest girl_ with flowers in the spring, holding a summer festival on the _Midsummer_ eve, giving thanks for harvest in the autumn, and throwing a _holly wreath_ into the current in the winter.
After a long period of _rain_, the river may overflow its banks.
This is a rare _occurrence_,as _our_ climates _seldom_ _goes_ to _extremes_.
We are lucky in that only _the_ lower fields which make up a very small proportion of our farm are affected by flooding.
But other farms are less _favourably_ _sited_, and flooding can sometimes _spell disasters for_ their owners.
One bad winter, we watched the river _creep up_ the lower meadow.
All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little.
We were, however, worried about our _nearest_ neighbours whose farm was _low lying_, and who were new comers to the district.
As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we can not find out how they were managing.
