Lesson Fourteen Part one  The Butterfly Effect

Why do small _errors_ make it _impossible_ to predict the _weather system_ with a high degree of accuracy?

Beyond two or three days, the world's best weather forecasts are _speculative_, and beyond six or seven days, they are worthless.
The butterfly effect is the reason.
For small piece of weather and two of global forecast, small can mean thunder storms and blazes, any prediction _ditiarits_ rapidly
Errors and _uncertainties_ multiply, _cascading_ upwards _through a chain of_ _turbulent_ features, from dust devils and squalls up to continent-size eddies that only _the_ _satellites_ can see.
The modern weather models work with a _grid of_ _points_ of the _order_ of sixty-miles apart   , and even so, some starting data had to be _guessed_, since ground stations and satellites can not see everywhere.
But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot the part, _rising_ at one foot intervals, all the way to the _top_ of the atmosphere.
Suppose every sensor gives the perfectly accurate reading of temperature, _pressure_, humidity and any other quantity a _meteorologist_ would want.
