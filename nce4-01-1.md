## 课文原文20170517

Lesson one  Part one  Finding fossil man 

Why are _legends_ _handed_ down by storytellers useful?

We can read of things that happened five thousand years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write.
But there are some parts of world where even now people can not write.
The only way _that_ can preserve their history is to recount _it as sagas_, legends handed down from one generation of storytellers to another.
These legends are useful because they could tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did.
_Anthropologists_ wondered _where the remote ancestors_ of the _Polynesian_ people, now live in the Pacific islands came from.
The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about two thousand years ago.
