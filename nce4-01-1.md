Lesson one  Part one  Finding fossil man 

Why are _legends_ _handed_ down by storytellers useful?

We can read of things that happened five thousand years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write.
But there are some parts of world where even now people can not write.
The only way _that_ they can preserve their history is to recount _it as sagas_, legends handed down from one generation of storytellers to another.
These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did.
_Anthropologists_ wondered _where the remote  ancestors_ of the _Polynesian_ peoples  now live in the Pacific islands  came from.
The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about two thousand years ago.
