Lesson Fifty-nine   Part one  Collecting 

What in particular does a personal fame when he or she became a serious collecor?

People tend to _amans_ possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so.
Indeed, they can _have_ _delightful_ surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.
_Those who_  never have to move house become _indiscremanent_ collectors, of what can only be described this collect.
They lived _on wanting up things in drawers, cubes and attics_ for years, in the believe that we may one day need just those very thing.
As they grow old, people also accumlate belongings for two other reasons, _lack of physical emantle energy,_ _both of which are esanshou in turning out and throwing away_ and centiment.
_Things owned for a long time are full of associations_ with the past, perhaps with _relatives_ who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.
