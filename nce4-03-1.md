Lesson Three  Part One _Matterhorn_ Man

What was the main objective of early mountain climbers?

_Modern alpinsts_ try to climb mountains by a route which would give them good sport, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regareded. 
In the _pioneering_ days, however, this was not the case at all.
The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, because the summit was the _prize_ they _sought_, especailly if it had never been _attained_ before.
It is true that during their explorations, they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most _perilous_ nature, equipped in the manner which would make _modern_ climbers _shudder at the thought_, but they did not go out of their way to _court_ such an _excitement_.
They had a single aim, a _solitary_ _goal_, the top.
