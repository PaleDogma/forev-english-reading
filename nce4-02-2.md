Lesson Two  Part One  Spare that spider

How much of each year do spiders spend killing insects?

Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends.
Because they destory so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race.
Insects would make it impossible for us in the world, they will devour all our crops, and kill our flocks and herds, if we were not _for_ the protection we get from the insect-eating animals.
We _owe a lot_ to the birds and beasts, who eat insects, but all of _them_ put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders.
Moreover, unlike some of the other insect _eaters_, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongs.
Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them.
One can tell the differece almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs, and an insect never more than six.

How many spiders are engaged in this work on our behalf?
One authorities on spiders made a _census_ of the spiders _in a_  grass field in the south of England and he estimated that there were more than two million two hundred fifty thousand _in one are_ that is something like six million spiders of different kinds on a foot _pitch_.
