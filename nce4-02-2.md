Lesson Two  Part Two  Spare that spider

How much of each year do spiders spend killing insects?

How many spiders are engaged in this work on our behalf?
One authority on spiders made a _census_ of the spiders _in a_  grass field in the south of England and he estimated that there were more than two million two hundred fifty thousand _in one are_ that is something like six million spiders of different kinds on a football _pitch_.
Spiders are busy, for at least half of the year in killing insects.
It is impossible to make more than _the wildest guess at_ how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not contend with only three meals a day. 
It _has been_ estimated that the weight of all the insects destoryed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country.
