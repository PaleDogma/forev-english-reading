Lesson Nine Part One Royal _espionage_

What important thing did King _Alfred_ when he _penetrated_ the Danish camp _of_ _Guthrum_?

Alfred the Great acted as his own spy visiting Danish camps _disguised_ as a _minstrel_.
In those days, wondering _minstrels_ were welcome everywhere.
They were not fightingmen, and their _harp_ was their passport.
Alfred had learned many of their _ballads_ in his youth, _and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring_.
While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at _Athlney_, the king, himself, set out to _penetrated the camp of  Guthrum_ ,the commander of the Danish invaders.
These had set down for the winter at _Chippenham_, _thither_ Alfred went.
He noticed at once that the _discipline_ was slack, the Danes had the self-confidence of _conquerors_, and their _security_ precatuion were _casual_.
They lived well, on the _proceeds_ of _raids_ on neighbouring regions. 
There they collected women,as well as food and drink, and a life of ease have made them soft.
