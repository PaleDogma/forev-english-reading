Lesson Thirty  A death of a ghost

Why did the two brothers keep the secret?

For years,villagers believe that _Engley_ farm was haunted.
The farm was owned by two brothers,Joe and Bob Cox.
They employed a few _farmhands_,but no one was _willing_ to work there long.
Every time a worker _gave_ up his job,he told the same story.
_Farm laborers_ said that they always woke up to find that work had been done over night.
_He_ had been cut and cow sheds had been cleaned.
A farmworker, who stayed up _all_ night,_claimed_ to have see a figure cutting _corn_ in the _moonlight_.
In time,it became an _accepted_ fact that Cox brothers empliyed a _conscientious_ ghost that do the most of their work for them.
No man suspected that there must be someone else on the farm, who had never been seen.This was indeed the case.
A short time ago,villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of _Engley_ had died.
Everyone went to the funeral,for the ghost was _none other_ than _Eric_ Cox,a third brother who was supposed to die _as_ a young man.
After the funeral,Joe and Bob revealed the secret which they had kept for over fifty years.
_Eric_ had been the eldest son of the family,very much older than his two brothers.
He had been _obliged_ to join the army during the Second World War.
As he hated army life,he decided to desert his _regiment_.
When he learned that he would be sent abroad,he returned to the farm,and his father hid him until the end of the war.

_Fearin_ the _authorities_,Eric remained in hidding after the war as well.
His father told everybody that Eric had been killed in action.
The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob.
They did not even tell their wives.
When their father died,they thought their duty to keep Eric in hidding.
All these years,Eric had lives as a _recluse_.
He used to sleep during day and work _at_ night,quite _unaware of_ the fact that he had become the ghost of _Engley_.
When he died,however,his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.
