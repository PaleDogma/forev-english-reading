Lesson Thirty  The death of a ghost

Why did the two brothers keep the secret?

For years,villagers believed that _Engley_ farm was haunted.
The farm was owned by two brothers,Joe and Bob Cox.
They employed a few _farmhands_/ ,but no one was _willing_ to work there long.
Every time a worker _gave_ up his job/ ,he told the same\  story.
_Farm laborers_ said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight.
_Hay_ had been cut/ and cowsheds had been cleaned.
A farmworker, who stayed up _all_ night/,_claimed_ to have see a figure cutting _corn_ in the _moonlight_ \ .
In time/,it became an _accepted_ fact   that the Cox brothers employed a _conscientious_ ghost  that do the most of their work for them.
No man suspected   that there might be someone else on the farm, who had never been seen.
This was indeed  the case.
A short time ago,villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of _Engley_ had died.
Everyone went to the funeral,for the ghost was _none other_ than  _Eric_ Cox,a third brother  who/ was supposed to have died _as_ a young man.
After the funeral,Joe and Bob revealed the secret  which they had kept for over fifty years.
