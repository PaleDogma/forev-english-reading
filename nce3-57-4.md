Lesson Fifty-seven   Part Four  Back in the old country

Did the _narrator_ find his mother's grave?

The _curious_ thing was that the lake was not marked on the map.
I felt as if I had _stumbled_ into _a nightmare_ country, as you sometimes do in dreams.
And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me.
Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared _on the horizon_ a man on horseback, riding in my direction.
I waited _till_ he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village.
He said there was now no village.
I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name.
This time he pointed to the lake.
The village no longer existed, because it had been submerged and all the valley too.
The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made _reservoir_.
