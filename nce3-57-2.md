Lesson Fifty-seven   Part Two  Back in the old country

Did the _narrator_ find his mother's grave?

He always _meant_ to go back one day, but not to _stay_.
His roots and mine had become too firmly _embedded_ in the new land.
But He wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave.
He became _mortally_ ill a few months before when we had planned to go, and when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own. 
I hired a car the day after landing,and bought a _comprehesive book of_ maps which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last _stage_.
It was not that I actually _remembered_ anything at all.
But my father had decribed over and over again what we should see at every milestone after leaving the nearest town, so that I was _positive_ that I should recognize as _familiar territory_.
