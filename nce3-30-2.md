Lesson Thirty  A death of a ghost

Why did the two brothers keep the secret?

_Eric_ had been the eldest son of the family,very much older than his two brothers.
He had been _obliged_ to join the army during the Second World War.
As he hated army life,he decided to desert his _regiment_.
When he learnt that he would be sent abroad,he returned to the farm,and his father hid him until the end of the war.
_Fearing_ the _authorities_/ ,Eric remained in hiding after the war/ as well.
His father told everybody that Eric had been killed in action.
The only other people  who knew the secret  were Joe/ and Bob.
They did not even tell their wives.
When their father died,they thought it their duty  to keep Eric in hiding.
All these  years/,Eric had lives \ as a _recluse_.
He used to sleep during the day and work _at_ night,quite _unaware of_ the fact that he had become the ghost of _Engley_.
When he died however,his brothers found it \impossible\  to keep the secret any longer.
