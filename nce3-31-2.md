Lesson A lovable eccentric

Why did the shop assistant refuse to serve Dickie?

True eccentrics never deliberately set out draw attention to themselves.
They _disreagrd_ social conventions,without being _conscious_ that they are doing anything extraordinary.
This _invariably_ wins them the love and respect of others,for they add color to the _dull_ _routine_ of everyday life.
Up to the time of his death,Richard Colson was one of the most _notable figures_ in our town.
He was a _shrewd_ and wealthy businessman,but most of the people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life.
He was known to us all as Dickie,and his _eccentricity_ had become _legendary_ long before he died.
Dickie dislikes _snobs_ _intensely_.
Though he owened a large car,he hardly ever used it,preferring always to go on foot.
Even when it was raining heavily,he refused to carry an umbrella.
One day,he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a _particularly_ heavy shower.
He wanted to buy a three hundred pounds watch for his wife,but he was in such a _bedraggled_ condition that an assistant refused to serve him.

Dickie left the shop without word,and returned carrying a large clothbag.
As it was extremly heavy,he dumped it on the counter.
The assistant asked him to leave,but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager.
Recognizing who the _customer_ was,the manager was most apologetic,and _reprimanded_ the assistant _severely_.
When Dickie was given the watch,he presented the assistant with the colthbag.
It contained three hundred pounds in pennies.
He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left,thirty thousand pennies in all.
On another occasion,he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings.This exhibition received a great deal of attention _in the press_,for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists,they had in fact been painted by Dickie.
It took him four years to stage this _elaborate_ joke,simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.
