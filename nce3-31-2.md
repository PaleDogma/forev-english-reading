Lesson A lovable eccentric

Why did the shop assistant refuse to serve Dickie?

Dickie left the shop without word,and returned carrying a large cloth bag.
As it was extremly heavy,he dumped it on the counter.
The assistant asked him to leave,but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager.
Recognizing who the _customer_ was,the manager was most apologetic,and _reprimanded_ the assistant _severely_.
When Dickie was given the watch,he presented the assistant with the cloth bag.
It contained three hundred pounds in pennies.
He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left,thirty thousand pennies in all.
On another occasion,he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings.This exhibition received a great deal of attention _in the press_,for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists,they had in fact been painted by Dickie.
It took him four years to stage this _elaborate_ joke,simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.
