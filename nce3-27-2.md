Lesson Twenty-seven Nothing to sell and nothing to buy

What is the most important thing for a tramp?

A tramp  may ask you for money but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him.
He has _deliberately_ chosen   to live the life he _leads_, and _is_ _fully_ aware of the _consequences_.
He may never be sure  where the next meal  is //coming //from,but he is free   from the thousands _of anxieties_  which _afflicted_  other people.
His few material possessions   make it possible for him to move   from place to place  with ease.
By having to sleep in the open,he gets far closer to the world of nature   than most of us  //ever do.
He may hunt,beg,or steal occasionally, to keep himself alive.
He may,even,in times of real need \ ,do a little work,but he will never sacrifice his freedom.
We often speak of tramps/  with contempt,and put them in the same class  as beggars,but how many of us   can honestly say,that we had not _felt_ a little envious    of their simple way of life   and their freedom from care.
