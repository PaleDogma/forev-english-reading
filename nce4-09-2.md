Lesson Nine Part Two  Royal _espionage_

What important thing did King _Alfred_ when he _penetrated_ the Danish camp _of_ _Guthrum_?


Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athlney.
The force _there assemble_ was _trivial_ compared with Danish _horde_. 
But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer _fit_ for prolonged battle, and that their _commissariat_ had no _organization_, but depends on irregular _raids_.   
So _faced_ with Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle, but _harried_ the enemy.
He was _constantly_ on the move, drawing the Danes after him.
His _patrols halted the raiding parties_, _hunger_ _assailed_ the Danish army.
Now, Alfred began a long series _of skirmishes_, and within a month, the Danes had surrendered.
The _episode_ could reasonably serve as unique _epic_ of royal espionage.
