Lesson Sixty  Part Two  Too early and too late

Why did the young girl miss the train?

They are often more industrous useful citizens than those who are never late.
They over-punctual can be as much _trial_ to others, as they unpunctual. 
The guess to a arrives have never too soon is the greatest nusis.
Some friends of my family had this _irratating_ habit.
The only thing to do was to ask them to come half an hour that the other guesses.
Then they arrived just when we wanted them.
If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early that even a fraction of a minute too late.
Although being early may means wasting a little time, this would be _less_ than if you miss the train, and have to wait an hour or more for the next one.
And you are _void_ the frastration of _arriving_ at the very monent when the train is _driving_ out of the station, and being unable to get on it.
