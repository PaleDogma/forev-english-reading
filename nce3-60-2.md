Lesson Sixty  Part Two  Too early and too late

Why did the young girl miss the train?

They are often more _industrious_ useful citizens than those who are never late.
The over-punctual can be as much a _trial_ to others as _the_ unpunctual. 
The guest who arrives _half an hour_ too soon is the greatest _nuisance_.
Some friends of my family had this _irritating_ habit.
The only thing to do was to ask them to come half an hour later than the other _guests_.
Then they arrived just when we wanted them.
If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early _than_ even a fraction of a minute too late.
Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be _less_ than if you miss the train, and have to wait an hour or more for the next one.
And you _avoid_ the _frustration_ of _arriving_ at the very monent when the train is _drawing_ out of the station, and being unable to get on it.
