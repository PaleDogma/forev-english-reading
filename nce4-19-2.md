Lesson Nineteen  Part two  The stuff of dreams

What is going on when a person _experiences rapid eye-movements_ during sleep?


If it is not _a_ question of resting the body, then perhaps it is the brain that needs resting.
This might _be a plausible_ hypothesis _were it not for_ two factor.
First, the _electroencephalograph_ ( which is simply a device for recording the _electrical_ activity of the brain by attaching _electrodes_ to the _scalp_ ), shows that while there is a change _in the_ pattern _of_ activity during sleep, there is not evidence that the total amount of activity is any less.
The second factor is more interesting and more _fundamental_.
Some years ago, an American _psychiatrist_ named _William Dement_ pulished experiments _dealing with_ reording the eye-movements during sleep.
