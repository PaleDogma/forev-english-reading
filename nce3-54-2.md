Lesson Fifty-four   Part Two   Instinct or _Cleverness_

Was the writer successful in protecting his peach tree,why not?

We enjoy reading about them,espeically when we find that like the _praying_ _mantis_,they lead perfectly horrible lives.
We enjoy staring at them,_entranced_ as they go about their business,_unaware_ (we hope) of our presence. 
Who has not stood in _awe_ at the side of spider _pouncing_ on a fly,or a _column of_  ant, _triumphantly_ _bearing_ home an _enormous_ dead _beetle_.
Last summer,I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my price peach tree.The tree has grown against warm wall on the _sheltered_ side of the house.
I am espeically proud of it,not only because it _has survived_ several _severe_ winters,but because it occasionally produced _luscious_ peaches. 
During the summer,I noticed that the leaves of the tree were beginning to _wither_.
_Clusters_ of tiny insects called _aphids_ were to found on the underside of leaves.
