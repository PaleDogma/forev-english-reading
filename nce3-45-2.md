Lesson Forty-five  The power of press

Does the writer think the parents were lucky or unlucky to gain _prosperity_ in this way,why?

But they suddenly became the parents of _quintuplets_,four girls and a boy, an _event_ which radically changes their lives.
The day after the birth of the five children,an aeroplane arrived in _Aberdeen_,bringing 60 reporters and _photographers_.
The rise to fame was _swift_.
Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country.
Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to publish stories and photographes.
Gifts poured in,not only from unknown people,but from baby food and _soap_ manufacturers who wished to advertise their products.
The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced with a new, 500,000 dallar home.
Reports kept _pressing_ for interviews,so lawyers had been employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press _conferences_.
While the five babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in a  hospital nursery,their parents were paying the price for fame.
It would never again be possible for them to live normal lives.
They had became the victims of commercialization,for their names had acquired market value.
Instead of being five new family members,these children had immediately become _a commodity_.
