Lesson fifteen  Part one  Secrecy in Industry 

Why is _secrecy_  particularly important in the _chemical_ industries ?

Two factors we heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry.
One is the general atmosphere of _secrecy_, in which, it carried out, the other,the lack of the individual research work.
In so far as _any_ _encry_ is a secret one, it _naturally_ limits _all_ those engaged in carring it out _from an effective contact_ with their fellow scientists, either in other countries, or in univeristies, or even, often enough, in ohter departments of the same firm.
