Lesson fifteen  Part one  Secrecy in Industry 

Why is _secrecy_  particularly important in the _chemical_ industries ?

Two factors _weigh_ heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry.
One is the general atmosphere of _secrecy_, in which, it is carried out, the other,the lack of the individual research worker.
In so far as _any_ _inquiry_ is a secret one, it _naturally_ limits _all_ those engaged in carring it out _from effective contact_ with their fellow scientists, either in other countries, or in univeristies, or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm.
The degree of secrets _naturally_ varied considerably.
Some of the big firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundentmental nature, that it is a _positive_ advantage to them, not keep them secret.
