Lesson Eight Part One Trading standards  

What makes trading between rich countries difficult?
Chickens _slaughtered_ in the United States, claim officials in _Brussels_, are not fit to _grace_ European tables.
No, _say_ the Americans, our _fowl_ are fine, we simply clean them in a different way.
These day, it is differeces in national ragulations , far more than _tariffs_, that _put sand in the wheels_ of trade between rich coutries.
It is not just farmers who are complaining.
An _electric_ _razor_ that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American made _dialysis_ machine needs the EU's ok before it hits the market in Europe.
As it happened, a razor that is safe in Europe, is _unlikely_ to _electrocute_  Americans.
So ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why had two lots of tests where one would do?
