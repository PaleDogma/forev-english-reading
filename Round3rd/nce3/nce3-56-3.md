Lesson Fifty-six  Part Three  Our neighour, the river

From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point.
The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down.
Next came a horse, swimming bravely, byt we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted.
Suddly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah's ark, carring the whole familym a few hens, the dogs, a cat and a bird in a cage.
We realized that they must become *unduly* frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foufndations, would stood *stoutly* even if it had been almost submerged.
The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadow with *boathooks*, in the hope of being able to *grapple* a corner if the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank.
We still think it a miracle that they were able to do so.
