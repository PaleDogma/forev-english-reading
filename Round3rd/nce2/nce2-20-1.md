Lesson Twenty  One man in a boat

Why fishing is the writer's favorite sport?

Fishing is my favourite sport.
I _often_ fish _for hours_ without catching anything, but _this_ _does not worry_ me.
Some fishmen are unlucky.
_Instead_ of catching fish, they catch old boots _and_ rabbish.
I am even less _lucky_.
I never catch anything, not even old boots.
After _having_ spent whole morings _on the river_, I always go home with an empty bag.
"You must give up fishing," my friends _say_, "It's a waste of time."
But they don't realize one important thing,I'm not _really_ interested in fishing, I'm only interested in _sitting_ in a boat and doing nothing at all.
