Lesson Twenty-two A glass Envolope

How did Jane recevie a letter from a stranger?

My daughter, Jane, never dreamed _of_ receving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland.

Last year, we _were_ travelling across the channel and Jane put a piece of _paper_ with her name and address on it into a bottle.
She threw the bottle into the sea, she never thought of it again.
But _ten_ months later, she recevied a letter from a girl in Holland.
Both girls write to each other regularly now.
However, they _have_  decided to use the post office.
Letters will cost a little more,but _they will_  certainly transfer _fast_.
