Lesson Fifty-four Sticky fingers

What two interruptions did the writer have?

After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to shops.
It was still early when I returned home.
The children were at school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. 
So I decided to make some _meat pies_.
In a _short time_, I _was busy mixing_ butter and flour, and my _hands_ were soon covered _with_ sticky pastry.
At _exactly_ that moment, the telephone rang.
Nothing could _have been_ more annoying.
I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers, and was dismay when _I_ recognized the voice was Helen Bates.
It took me ten minutes to persude her to ring back later.
At last, I _hung_ up the receiver.
What a mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on the _telephone_, and on the _doorknobs_.
I had _not sooner_ _got back to_ the kitchen, _than_ the doorbell _rang_ _loud enough_ to wake up the dead.
This time _It was_ _the_ postman, and he wanted me to sign for a register letter.
