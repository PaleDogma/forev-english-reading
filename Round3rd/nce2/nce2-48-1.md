Lesson Forty-eight  Did you want to tell me something?

Why did the writer become very worried?

Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.
My dentist _had_ just pulled out one of my teeth, and had told me to rest for a while.
I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool.
He knew I collected match boxes, and asked me whether my collection was growing.
He then asked me how my brother was, and whether I liked my new job in London.
In answer to these questions, I either nodded or _made_ strang noises. 
Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching _out the hole_ where the tooth had been.
I suddenly _felt_ very worried, but could not say anything.
When the dentist at last _removed_ the cotton wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.
