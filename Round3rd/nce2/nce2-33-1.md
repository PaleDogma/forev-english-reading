Lesson Thirty-three  Out of the darkness

Why was the girl in hospital?

Nearly a week _passed before_ the girl was able to explain what _had_ happened to her.
One _afternoon_, she set out from the coast in a small boat, and _caught_ _in_ a storm.
Towards eleven, the boat _struck_ _a rock_, and the girl jumped into the sea.
Then she swam to _the shore after spending the whole night_ in the water.
During that time,she covered _a_ _distance of eight miles_.
Early next morning, she saw a light ahead.
She knew she was near the shore,because the light was _high_ up on the cliffs.
On _arriving at_ the shore, the girl struggled _up_ the cliff _towards the light she had seen_.
That was all she remembered.
When she woken up a day later, she found herself in hospital.
