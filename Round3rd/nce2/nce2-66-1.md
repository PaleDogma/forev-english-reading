Lesson Sixty-six  Sweet as honey

What was sweet as honey, and why?

In _1963_, a _lancaster **bomber crashed on Weily island**_  , a remote _**place in the south pacific**_, a long way _west of **smoa**_.
_The plane wasn't too damaged_, but over the years, the crash was forgotten, _and the reck remained undisturbed._
_By this time, a lancaster bomber **in reasonal condition** was rare_ and _worth_ rescuing.
The _frech authorities had the plane **packaged**_ and _moved in **parts**_ back to France.
Now, a group of _enthusiatists_ are going to have the plane restored.
It has four Rolls Royce _Merlin_ engines, but the group _will **need have only** one of them rebuilt._.
_**Imaging their surprise and delight**_, when they _broke open_ the package _cases_, and _found_ four engines _were_ sweet as honey, still in perfect condition.
A _colony_ of bees had turned the engine into a hive, and _it was_ totally preserved in _**beeswax**_.
