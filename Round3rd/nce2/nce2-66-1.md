Lesson Sixty-six  Sweet as honey

What was sweet as honey, and why?

In _1963_, a _Lancaster **bomber crashed on Wallis Island**_, a remote _**place in the south Pacific**_, a long way _west of **Samoa**_.
_The plane wasn't too badly damaged_, but over the years, the crash was forgotten, _and the **wreck** remained undisturbed._
_Then in 1989,twenty-six years after the crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island._
_By this time, a Lancaster bomber **in reasonable condition** was rare_ and _worth_ rescuing.
The _Frech authorities had the plane **packaged**_ and _moved in **parts**_ back to France.
Now, a group of _enthusiatists_ are going to have the plane restored.
It has four Rolls Royce _Merlin_ engines, but the group _will **need have only** three of them rebuilt._.
_**Imaging their surprise and delight**_, when they _broke open_ the _packing_ _cases_, and _found_ _that the_ fourth engine _was_ sweet as honey, still in perfect condition.
A _colony_ of bees had turned the engine into a hive, and _it was_ totally preserved in _**beeswax**_.
