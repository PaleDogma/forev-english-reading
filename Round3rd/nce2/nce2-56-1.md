Lesson Fifty-six  Faster than sound

How fast did the _winning_ car go?

Once a year, a race _is_ held for old cars.
_A lot of_ cars _**entered** for this race_ last year, and there was _a great deal of excitement_ _just_ before it began.
One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls Royce Sliver Ghost.
The most unusual car was a _Benz_ , which had only three wheels.
Built in 1885, it was the oldest car taking part.
After a _great many loud explosions_, the race began.
Many of cars broke down _on the course_, and _some_ drivers spent more time under their cars than in them.
A few cars, however, _completed_ the race, the _**winning**_ _car, reached the speed of forty miles at an hour_, much _faster than any **of** its rivials_.
_**It sped downhill at** the end of the race_, and its drivers had a lot of trouble _trying_ to stop it.
The race gave everyone a great deal of _pleasure_.
It _was very_ different from _modern_ _races_, but no less exciting.
