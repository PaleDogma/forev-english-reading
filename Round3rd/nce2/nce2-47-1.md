Lesson Forty-seven  A thirsty ghost

What evidence is there of a ghost?

A public house which _was **recently** bought_ by Mr _Ian_ Thomson _is up for sale_.
Mr Thomson is going to _sell it_, because it is _haunted_.
He _told_ me that he could not _go to_ sleep _one_ night, because _he heard_ _a_ strange noise coming from the bar.
The next morning, he found that _the doors had been **blocked by chairs**_  and _the_ furniture had been moved.
Though Mr Thomson had turned the lights _off_ before he went to bed, they _were_ on in the morning.
He also said that he had found five empty _Whisky_ bottles which the ghost _must have drunk_ the night before.
When I _suggested_ that some villagers _might have_ come in for a free drink, Mr Thomson shook his _head_.
The villagers _have_told him they will not accept the pub, even _if_ he gives it away.
