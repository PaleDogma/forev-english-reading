Lesson Fifty _Taken_ for a ride

Why did the writer not get off the bus at _Woodford Green_?

I _love_ travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.
I went _on_ an excursion _recently_, but my trip _took me_ longer than I expected.
"I am going to Woodford Green," I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, "but I don't know where it is."
"I'll tell you where to get off." answered the conductor.
I sat in the _front_ of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.
After some time, the bus stopped.
Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger _left on_ the bus.
"You'll have to get off here," the conductor said, "This is as far as we go."
"Is this Woodford Green?" I asked.
"Oh dear," said the conductor suddenly, "I forgot to put you off."
"It doesn't matter," I said, "I'll get off here."
"We are going back now." said the conductor.
"Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus." I answered.
