Lesson Nineteen Sold out

When will the writer see the play?

"The play maybe begin at any moment." I said.
"It _may_ have begun already." Susan answered.
I hurried to the ticket office, "May I have two tickets please?" I asked.
"I'm sorry, _we've_ sold out." The girl said.
"What a pity!" Susan _exclaimed_.
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
"Can I return these two tickets?" he asked.
"Certainly!" The girl said.
I went _back_ to the ticket office at once.
"Could I have those two tickets please?" I asked.
"Certainly," the girl said, "But they're  for _next_ Wednesday's performance, do you still want them?"
"I _might as well_  have them." I said sadly.
