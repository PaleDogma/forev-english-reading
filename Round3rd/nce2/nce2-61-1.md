Lesson Sixty-one  Trouble with the Hubble

What is the special importance of a telescope in space?

The Hubble telescope was launched _into space_ by NASA, _on April 20th, 1990_, at a cost of _over_ a billion dallars.
Right from its start, there was a trouble with the Hubble.
The pictures _it sent us were very disappointing, because its main mirror was **faulty**._
NASA _is now going to put the telescope right_, so it **will soon be sending up** four astranauts to repair it._
The shuttle _Endeavour_ will be taking the astranauts to the Hubble.
_**A robot arm was from the Endeavour to grab the telescope ans hold it ,while **the astranauts make the necessary repairs.
Of course, _The Hubble is _**above** the **earth**_ atmosphere, it will _soon_ send us **the clearest** pictures of stars and_ distant galaxies that we have never seen.
The Hubble will tell us a great deal _about **the age** and the size_ of the universe.
By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle eye will _have sent_ us thousands and thousands _of_ wonderful pictures.
