Lesson Fifty-eight   A _blessing_ in disguise

Why does the _vicar_ refuse to cut down the tree?

_The_ tiny village _of Frinley_ _is said to possess_ a cursed tree.
Because _the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has_ now increased.
The tree was planted _near the church_ fifty years ago, but it is only _in_ recent years that it _has_ gained an evil reputation.
It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck, if picks a leaf, he will die.
Many _villagers_ believe that the tree had _already claimed a number of_ victims.
The vicar has been asked to _have the tree cut_ down, but so far he refused.
He _has_ pointed out that the tree _is_ a useful soure of income, _as_ tourists _have been coming from_ all parts of the country to see it.
In spite of all _that_ has been said, the tourists _have been_ _picking_ leaves and cutting their names on the tree trunk.
So far, _not one_ of them has been _struck down_ by sudden death.
