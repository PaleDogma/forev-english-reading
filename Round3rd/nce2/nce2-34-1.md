Lesson Thirty-four  Quick work

How long had the police taken to find his bicycle?

Dan Robinson _has_ been worried all week.
Last _Tuesday_, he received a letter from the local police.
In the letter, he was asked to call at the station.
Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to the station yesterday, and now he is not worried any more.
At the station, he was told by a _smiling_ policeman that his bicycle _had been_ found.
Five days ago, _the policeman told him_ _the bicycle was picked up in a small village_ _four_ hundred miles away.
It is now being sent to _his home_ by train.
Dan was most surprized when he heard the news.
He was amused too, because he never expected the bicycle _to_ be found.
It was stolen ten years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen.
