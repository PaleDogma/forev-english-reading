Lesson Forty-nine  The end of a dream

How did the dream end?

_Tired of sleeping on the floor_, a young man in _Teheran_ saved up for years to buy a real bed.
For the first time _in_ his life, he became the proud owner of a bed _which had_ springs and a mattress.
Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed onto the roof of his house.
He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up.
A gust of wind _swept the bed off the roof_, _and sent it crashing into_ the _courtyard_ _below_.
The young man did not wake up until the bed _had_ struck the ground.
Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was _miraculously_ unhurt.
When he woke up, he was still on the mattress.
_**Glancing at** bits of wood **and metal that** lay around him_, the man sadly picked up the mattress, and carried it into his house.
After he had put it on the floor, he _**promptly**_ went to sleep again.
