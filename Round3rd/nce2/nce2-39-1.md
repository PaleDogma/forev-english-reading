Lesson Thirty-nine  Am I all right?

Why did Mr Gilbert telephone Doctor Milington?

While John Gilert was in hospital, he asked his doctor _to_ tell him whether his operation _had been_  sucessful, but the doctor refused to do so.
The following day, the patient asked a _bedside_ telephone.
When he was alone, he telephoned the hospital _exchange_, and asked _for_ Doctor Milington.
When the doctor answered the phone, Mr Gilbert said he was inquiring a certain patient, a Mr John Gilbert.
He asked if Mr Gilbert's operation had been successful, _and_ the doctor told him that it had been.
He then asked when Mr Gilbert _would be_ allowed to go home, and the doctor told him that _he_ would have to stay in hospital for another two weeks.
Then Doctor Milington asked the caller if he _was_ a relative of the patient.
"No," the caller answered, "I am Mr John Gilbert.".
