Lesson Sixty-four  The Channel Tunnel

Why was the first tunnel not completed?

In _1858_, a _french engineer_, _Aime Thome de Gamond_ ,arrived _in_ England with a plan **for _a_ twenty-one mile** tunnel _under the English Channel_ .
He said _that_ it would be possible to build a platform in the _centre_ of the Channel.
This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.
The tunnel would be well _ventilated_ if tall _chimneys_ were build above sea level.
In _1860_, a better plan was _put forward_ by an Englishman, William Low.
He suggested that a double-railway tunnel should be built.
This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered _this_ tunnel, it would _draw in_ fresh air behind it.
_42_ years later, a tunnel was _actually_ begun.
If, at _the_ time, the British _had not feared_ invasion, it would have _been_ completed.
The world _had to_ wait _almost_ anothor **one hundred** years for the Channel tunnel.
_It was officially opened on March 7th ,1994_, finally _connecting_ the Britain to the European continent.
