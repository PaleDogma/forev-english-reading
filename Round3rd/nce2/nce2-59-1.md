Lesson Fifty-nine  In or out 

Why did Rex _run away_?

Our dog, Rex, used to sit _outside_ our gate and bark.
Every _time_, he wanted to come into the garden, he would bark until someone opened the gate.
As the neighours complained _of_the noise, my husband spent some _weeks_ training him to _press_ his paw on the _latch_ to let himself in.
Rex soon became _an_ expert _at_ openning the gate.
However, when I was going _out shopping_ last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate.
This time, he was barking so that someone would let him out.
Since then, he has developed another bad habit.
_As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden, and waits until the gate shuts._
Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out.
After this, he immediately lets himself in and _begins barking_ again.
Yesterday my husband removed the gate, Rex got so annoyed we _have not seen_ him since.
