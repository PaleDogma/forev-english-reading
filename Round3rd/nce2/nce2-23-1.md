Lesson Twenty-three  A new house

Why is the new house special?

I had a letter from my sister yesterday.
She lives in Nigeria.
In her letter, she _said_ she _would_ come to England next year.
If she comes, she will get a surprise.
We are now living in a _beautiful new_ house in the country.
Work on it had begun before my sister left.
The house was completed five months ago.
In my letter, I told her _that_ she could stay with us.
The house has many large rooms, and there is a lovely garden.
It is a very modern house, so it _looks_ strange for some people.
It must be the only modern house in _the_ district.
