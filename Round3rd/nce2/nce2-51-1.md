Lesson Fifty-one  Reward for virtue

Why did _Hugh's_ _diet_ not work?

My friend,Hugh, has always been fat, _but **things** got so **bad** recently that_ he decided to go on a diet.
He began his diet a week ago.
First of all, he wrote out a long _list_ of _all the_ foods which were forbidden.
The list included most of _the things_ Hugh loves, butter,potatoes, rice, beer, milk, chocolate and sweets.
Yesterday, I paid him a visit, I rang the _bell_ and  was not surprised to _see_ that Hugh was still as fat as ever.
He _led_ me into his _room_, and hurriedly _hid_ a large parcel under his desk.
It was obvious that he was very _embarrassed_.
When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled _guiltily_, and then put the parcel on the desk.
He explained that his diet was so _strict_ that he _had to_ reward himself occasionally.
Then he showed me the contents of the parcel.
It contained five large _bars_ of chocolate, and three bags of sweets.
