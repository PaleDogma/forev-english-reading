Lesson Fifty-three  Hot snake

What caused the fire?

At last, firemen have put out a big forest fire in California.
Since then, they have been busy trying to find out _how_ the fire began.
Forest fires are _often_ caused by broken glass or by cigaritte ends which people casually throw away.
Yesterday, the firemen _examined_ the ground _carefully_, but were not able to find broken glass.
They _were often quitely_ sure that the cigaritte ends did not start the fire.
This morning, however, a fireman accidentally _discovered_ the cause.
He noticed _the remains of a snake_ _which **was wound** around the **electrical** wire of **a** sixteen thousand_  volt power-line.
In the way, he was able to _solve_ the mystery.
The explanation was very simple but very unusual.
A bird had snatched of this snake from the ground, and _then dropped_ it on _to_ the wire.
The snake then wound itself round the wire.
When it did so, it _sent sparks down to_ ground, _and this_ immediately started a fire.
