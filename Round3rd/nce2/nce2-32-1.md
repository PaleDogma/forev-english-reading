Lesson Thirty-two  Shopping made easy

Who is the thief?

People are not so honest as they once _were_.
The temptation _to steal_ is _greater_ than ever before--especially in large shops.
A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings.
One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual _when the woman came in_, so it was easier for the detective to watch her.
The woman first bought a few small articles.
After a little time, she chose _one of the most_ expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who _wrapped it up_ for her as quickly as possible.
Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying.
When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop-assistant was her daughter.
The girl' gave' her mother a free dress once a week !
