Lesson Thirty-five  Stop thief

How did Roy stop the theives?

Roy Trendon used to drive _a_ taxi.
A short while ago, however, he became a bus driver, _and he has not **regretted**_ it.
He _is finding_ his new work far more exciting.
When he _was driving_ _**along Catford Street** recently_ , he _saw_ two thieves rush out of a shop, and ran towards a waiting car.
One of them was carring a bag full of money.
Roy acted quickly, and drove the bus _straight at_ the thieves.
The one _with the_ money _got_ such a _fright_ that he droped the bag.
_As_ the thieves _was trying to _get away_ _in their car_, Roy drove the bus into its back _of it_.
_While the_ _**battered**_ car _was moving away_, Roy stopped _his_ bus and telephoned the police.
The _thieve's_ car was _badly_ damaged, and easy to be recognized.
Shortly _afterwards_, the police _stopped_ the car, and both men were arrested.
