Lesson Sixty-two  After the fire

What was the danger to the villages after the fire.
Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could _get it_ under control.
_A short time before_, _great trees **had covered** the countryside for miles around_.
Now _**smoke still rose up** from the warm ground over the **desolate** hills_.
Winter _was_ coming _on_, and the hills **threaten** _the surrounding villages with **destruction**_, for _heavy rain would_ not only wash away the soil ,but _would_ cause serious floods _as well_.
_When the fire _had_ at last been put out,_ the forest authorities ordered serveal tons of **special type of** grass seed which would grow quickly.
The seed was sprayed _over the ground_, _in_ huge _quantities_ by aeroplanes.
_The **planes** had been planting seeds **for nearly a month**  when it began to **rain**_.
By then, however, in many places, the grass _had_ alreay taken root.
_In place of the great trees which had _been growing_ there for centuries_, _**patches** of green had **begun to appear**_ Gin the blacken soil.
