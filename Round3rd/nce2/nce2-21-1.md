Lesson Twenty-one Mad or not

Why do people think the writer is mad?

Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad.
I live near an airport, and passing planes can be heard _night and day_.
The airport was built years ago, but for some reason, it _could_ not _be_ used then.
Last year, however, it came into use.
Over a hundred people must have been driven away _from their homes_ by the noise.
I am one of the few people left.
Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by _a_ passing plane.
I _have_ been offered a large sum of money to _go away_, but I am _determined_ to stay here.
_Everybody says_ I must be mad, and they are probably right.
