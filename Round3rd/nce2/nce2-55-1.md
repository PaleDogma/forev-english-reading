Lesson  Fifty-five  Not a good mine

What did the team find?

Dreams of finding lost treasure _almost_ _came_ true recently.
A new machine called _the_ revealer _has_ been invented, and _it has_ been used to detect gold which _has been_ buried in the ground.
The machine was used in a cave near _the seashore_,_where_, _it_ is said, pirates used to hide gold.
The pirates _would often bury gold_ in the cave and then fail to _collect it_.
Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave, hoping to find buried treasure.
_The leader of the party was examining the soil near the **entrance** to the cave_, _when_ the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.
Very excited, the party dug hole, two feet deep.
_**They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless**_
The party then searched the whole cave thoroghly, but did not find _anything_ except an empty tin trunk.
In spite of this, many people _are confident that_ _the revealer_ _may reveal_ something _of **value fairly**_ soon.
