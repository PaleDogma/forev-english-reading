Lesson Fifty-seven  Can I help you, madam?

Did the woman get what she wanted?
 
A woman in _jeans_ stood at _the_ window of _an expensive_ shop.
Though she hesitated for a monment, she _finally_ went in and asked to see a dress _that was_ in the window. 
The assistant who served her did not like the way she dressed.
Glancing at her scornfully, she told her that _the dress_ was sold.
The woman walked out of the shop angrily, and decided to punish the assistant next day.
She returned _to_ the shop the following morning, dressed in a fur _coat_, with a handbag _in_ one hand, and a long umbrella _in_ the other hand.
After seeking out of the rude assistant, she asked _for_ the same dress.
Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time.
With great difficulty, she climbed _into_ the _shop_ window to get the dress.
As soon as she _saw_ it, the woman said she did not like it.
She enjoyed herself making the assistant to _bring almost everything_ in the shop window, _before finally buying the dress she had first asked for_.
