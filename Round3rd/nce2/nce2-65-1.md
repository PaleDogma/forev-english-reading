Lesson Sixty-five Jumbo versus the police

Why did the police have to put Jumbo off the main street?

Last Christmas, _**the circus owner**_,Jimmy _Gates_, _decided to_ take some presents to a children's hospital.
Dressed up _as_ Christmas Father, _and_ accompanied _**by a 'guard of honor' of six**_ pretty girls, he _set off down_  the main street _of the city_, riding a baby elephant, called Jumbo.
He should have known that the police _would_ never _allow_ this sort of thing.
A policeman approached Jim and told him that he ought to **have gone _along_** the _**a side street**_, as Jumbo _was holdong_ up the traffic.
Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move.
Fifteen policemen had to _push very_ hard to get him off the main street.
The police had a difficult time but they were most amused.
"Jumbo must weigh a few tons" said a policeman afterwards.
"so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him."
"Of course we should arrest him, but as he _has_ a good record, we _shall_ let him off this time."
