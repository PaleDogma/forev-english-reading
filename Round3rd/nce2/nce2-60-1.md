Lesson Sixty The future

Does what Madam Bellinsky said come true?

_**At a village fair**_, I decided to visit a _**fortune** teller_, called Madam Bellinsky.
I went into _her_ tent, and she told me to sit down.
After _I had_ given her some money, she looked into a crystal ball and said:
"A relation of yours is coming to see you. 
She will _be arriving_ _this evening_ and intends to stay for _a few_ days.
"The moment you leave this tent, you will get a _big_ surprise."
A woman you know well will rush towards you.
She will speak to you, and _then_ she will lead your away _from_ this place. That is all."
As soon as I _went outside_, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky, because my wife _hurried towards me_.
"Where _have you been hiding_?" she asked _impatiently._
"Your sister will be here// _in less than an hour_, and we must _be at the_ station to meet her, we are late already."
As she _walked away_, I followed her out of the fair.
