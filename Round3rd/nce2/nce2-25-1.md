Lesson Twenty-five  Do the English speak English?

Why does the Writer not undertand the porter?

I arrived _in_ _London_ at last.
The railway station is big, black and dark.
I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter.
I not only _spoke_ English _very_ carefully, but _very_ clearly as well. 
The porter, however, could not understand me.
I repeated my question serveral times, and at last he understood.
He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly, nor clearly.
"I am a foreigner." I said.
Then, he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him.
My teacher never spoke English like that.
The porter and I looked at each other and smiled.
Then he said something _and_  I understood _it_.
"You'll soon learn English." He said.
I wondered, in England, each person speaks a different language.
The English understand each other, but I don't understand them.
Do they speak English?
