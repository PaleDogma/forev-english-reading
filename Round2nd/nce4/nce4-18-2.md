Lesson Eighteen  Part two  porpoises

What would you _say_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies.
It is possible that _upon such an_ occasion, _a battle ensued_ ,with sharks being driven away or killed.
Whether it be _bird_, fish or beast, the porpoise is _intrigued_ with anything that is _alive_.
They are _constantly_ _after_ the _turtles_, who peacefully _submit_ to all sorts of _indignities_.
One young _calf_ especially enjoyed _raising_ a _turtle_ to the surface with his _snout_, and then _shoving him across_ the tank _like an aquaplane_.

Almost any day, a young porpoise may be seen  trying to turn a three hundred pound _sea turtle_ over  by _sticking_ his _snout_ under the _edge of his shell_  ,and pushing up   for dear life.
