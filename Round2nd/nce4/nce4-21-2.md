Lesson Twenty-one  Part two  William S Hart and the early western film

How did William _Hart's_ _childhood_ _prepare him for his acting role_ in western films?  

And although no _period_ or _place_ in American history, has been _more_ _absurbly_ _romanticized_ _myth_ and _reality_ did join hands in at least one arena, the conflict between the individual and _encroaching_ civilization. 
Man are accustomed to struggling for survival aganist the _elements_ ,and Indians, were _bewildered_  by _politicians_, bankers and businessmen, and unhorsed by _fences_, _laws_ and alien _taboos_.
Hart's good-bad man, was always _an outsider_, _always one of the disinherited_ and he found it neccesary to shoot a sherrif or rob a bank along the away, his early audiences found it easy to understand and forgive, easpecially when he was Hart who ,in the end, _overcame_ the _attacking_ of Indians.
Audiences in the second _decade_ of the _twentieth_ century, found it _pleasent_ to escape to a time when life though hard, was _relatively_ simple 
We still do living in the world, in which _undeclared agrresion, war, hypocrisy, chicanery, and impending immolation_ are part of daily lives, we all want _a code_ live by.
