Lesson Two  Part One  Spare that spider

How much of each year do spiders spend killing insects?

Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends.
Because they destory so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race.
Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world, they will devour all our crops, and kill our flocks and herds, if we were not _for_ the protection we get from the insect-eating animals.
We _owe a lot_ to the birds and beasts, who eat insects, but all of _them_ put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders.
Moreover, unlike some of the other insect _eaters_, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongs.
Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them.
One can tell the differece almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs, and an insect never more than six.
