Lesson Eighteen  Part one  porpoises

What would you _say_ is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

There has long been a superstition among _mariners_  that porposes will save _drowning_ men by pushing them to the surface, or protect them from sharks by surrouding them  in defensive formation.
Marine Studio _biologists_ had _pointed out_ that, however intelligent they may be, it is probably a mistake to _credit_ dolphins with any _motive_ of life saving.
On the occasions when they have pushed _to_ shore _an unconscious human being_ ,they _have much more_ likely done it out of curiosity, or for a sport, as _in riding the bow_ waves of a ship.

In 1928, some porpoises  were photographed   working like _beavers_  to push ashore, a _waterlogged_ _mattress_.
If as has been reported, they had protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them, and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks.
