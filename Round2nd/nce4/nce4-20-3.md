Lesson Twenty  Part three  Snake poison

What are the two different ways in which snake posion acts?

_Vipers_ (_adders_) and _rattlesnakes_ _manufacure_ the blood poison, which is known as _haemolytic_.
Both posions are _unpleasant_ , but by far, the more _unpleasant_ is the blood poison.
It is said the nerve poison is the _more primitive_ of the two, then the blood poison is, so to speak , a _newer_ product from _an_ improved _formula_.
_Be that as it may_, the nerve poison does its business with man, far more quickly than the blood poison.
This, however, means nothing.
Snakes did not acquire their poison for use aganist man, but for use against prays such as rats and _mice_, and _the_ effects on these of _viperine_ posion is almost immediate.
