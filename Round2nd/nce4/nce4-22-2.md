Lesson Twenty-two  Part two  Knowledge and _Progress_

In what two _areas_ had people made no progress at all?

Then knowledge began to be accumlated, according to a _systematic_ plan.
The _trickle_ became a stream,  the stream has now became a torrent.
Moreover, as soon as new knowledge is acquired, it is now _turned to practical account_.
What is called "_modern civilization_", is not the result of _balanced_ development of all man's _nature_, but of accumulated knowledge applied to _practical_ life.
The problem now facing _humanity_ is, what is going to be done with all this knowledge.
As it so often pointed out, knowledge is a _two-edged_ weapon which can be used _equally_ for good or _evil_.
It is now being used _indifferently_ for both.
Could _any spectacle, for instance, be more grimly whimsical_ _than_ that of gunners using science ,to _shatter_ _men_'s _bodies_, while _close at_ hand, surgeons use it to restore them?
We have to ask ourselves very seriously, what will happen, if this _twofold_ use of knowlege, with its ever-increasing power, continues.

G.N.M. Tyrrell  The _personality_ of man
