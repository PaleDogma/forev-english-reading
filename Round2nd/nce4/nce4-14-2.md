Lesson Fourteen Part Two  The Butterfly Effect

Why do small _errors_ make it _impossible_ to predict the _weather system_ with a high degree of accuracy?

Suppose every sensor gives the perfectly accurate readings of temperature, _pressure_, humidity and any other quantity a _meteorologist_ would want.

Precisely at _noon_, an infinitely powerful computer, takes all the data and _calculates_ _what will happen_ at each point, at 12:01, then 12:02, then 12:03.
The computer will still be unable to predict whether _Princeton, New Jersey_  will have sun or rain on a day one month away.
At _noon_, the spaces between the sensors will _hide_ fluctuations, that the computer will not know about, tiny deviations from the average.
By 12:01, those fluctuations will already have created small errors one foot away.
Soon the errors will have multiplied to the ten-foot scale, and so on up to the size of the globe.

James Glik, Chaos
