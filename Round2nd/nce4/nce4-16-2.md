Lesson Sixteen  Part one the Modern city 

What is the _author's_ main argument about the modern city?


The _shape_ and _dimensions_ of the _skyscrapers_ ,depending _entirely_ on the _necessity_ of _obtaining_  maximum income _per square_  _foot of_ the ground,and of offering to the tenants offices and _apartments_ that please them.
This _caused_ the _construction_ as gigantic buildings where too _large masses of_  human beings are crowded together.

Civilized men like such a _way_ of living.
While they enjoy the comfort and _banal_ _luxury_ of their _dewelling_, they did not realize they _are_ deprived of the necessities  of life.
The modern city consists of _monstrous edifices_ ,and of dark ,_narrow streets full of petrol fumes and toxicgases_, torn by the noise of the _taxicabs_, lorries and buses, and _thronged ceaselessly_ by the great crowds
Obviously, it has not been _planned_ for the good of its habitants.

_Ileks, caro_ ,Man, the unknown,
