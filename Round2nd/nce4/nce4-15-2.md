Lesson fifteen  Part two  Secrecy in Industry 

Why is _secrecy_  particularly important in the _chemical_ industries ?

Yet a great many _processes_ depending on such research are _sought_ for  with complete  secrecy, until the stage at which _patents_ can be taken out. 
Even more processes are not patented at all, but kept as secret processes.
This _applies_ particularly to chemical industries, where _chance_ discoveries play a much larger part/  than they do in physical and _mechanical_ industries.

Sometimes, the _secrecy_ goes to such an _extent_ that the whole nature of the research can not be mentioned.
Many firms,for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining _technical_ or scientific books from libraries, because they are unwilling to have their names _entered_  ,as having taken _out_  such and such a book, for fear the _agents of other firms_  should be able to trace _the kind of_ the research   they are likely to _to be undertaking_.

J.D.Berno  the _social_ function of science
