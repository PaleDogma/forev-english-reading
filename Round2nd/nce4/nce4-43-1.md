Lesson Forty-three  Part one   Are there strangers in space

What does the 'uniquely rational way' for us to communicate with other intelligent beings in space depend on?

We must conclude from the work of those who have studies the origin of life, that given a planet only approximately like our own, life is almost certain to start.
Of all the planets in our own solar system, we are now pretty certain  the Earth is the only one  on which  life can survive.
Mars is too dry and poor in oxygen, Venus far too hot, and so is Mercury, and the outer planets have temperatures near absolute zero and hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.
But other suns, stars as the astronomers call them, are bound to have planets like our own, and as is the number of stars in the universe is so vast, this possibility becomes virtual certainty.
There are one hundred thousand million stars in our own Milky Way alone, and then there are three thousand million other milky ways or galaxies, in the universe.
So the number of stars that we know exist is now estimated at about 300 million million million.
