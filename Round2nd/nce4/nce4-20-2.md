Lesson Twenty  Part one  Snake poison

What are the two differnt ways in which snake posion acts?

In fact, it _would_ be an assistance to all _carnivores_, though it would be _two-edged_ weapon when they _fought_ each other.
But _of_ the _vertebrates_, _unpredictable_ nature selected only snakes, and one _lizard_.
One wonders also why nature, _with_ some snakes _concoted poison_ of such an extreme potency.
In the _conversion_ of _saliva_ _into_ poison, one may supposed _a fixed process_ _took  place_ , it did not.
Some snakes manufactured _a_ poison different in every respect from _that of_ others,  as different as _arsenic_ from _strcychnine_ and having diferent effects.
One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the _blood_.
The _makers of the nerve poison_ included _the mambas_ and _the cobras_ and _their venom is called neurotoxic_.
