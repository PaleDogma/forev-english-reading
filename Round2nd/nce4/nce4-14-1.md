Lesson Fourteen Part one  The Butterfly Effect

Why do small _errors_ make it _impossible_ to predict the _weather system_ with a high degree of accuracy?

Beyond two or three days, the world's best weather forecasts are _speculative_, and beyond six or seven , they are worthless.
The butterfly effect is the reason.
For small pieces of weather and to a global forecaster, small can mean thunderstorms and _blizzards_, any prediction _deteriorates_ rapidly.
Errors and _uncertainties_ multiply, _cascading_ upwards _through a chain of_ _turbulent_ features, from dust devils and squalls up to continent-size eddies that only _the_ _satellites_ can see.
The modern weather models work with a _grid of_ _points_ of the _order_ of sixty-miles apart   , and even so, some starting data had to be _guessed_, since ground stations and satellites can not see everywhere.
But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot apart, _rising_ at one foot intervals, all the way to the _top_   of the atmosphere.
