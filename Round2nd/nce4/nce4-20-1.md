Lesson Twenty  Part one  Snake poison

What are the two different ways in which snake posion acts?

How it came about _that_ snakes manufactured poison is a mystery.
Over the periods, their _saliva_, a _mild, digestive juice_ like our own, was converted into a posion that _defies_ analysis even today.
It was not _forced upon_ them, by the _survival_ _competition_, they could _have_ _caught and lived on_ pray without using posion, just as _the_ thousands of _non-poisonous_ snakes still do.
Posion to a snake is _merely_ a _luxury_ ,_it enables it_ to get its food with very little _effort_, not _more_ _effort_ than, one bite.
And why only snakes?
Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped, _no_ running _fights_ with _large_ _fierce_ rats or _tussles_ with _grown_ rabbits, just a bite, and no more _effort_ needed.
