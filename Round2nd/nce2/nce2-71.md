Lesson Seventy-one A famous clock

Has Big Ben ever gone wrong?

When you visit London,one of first things you will see is Big Ben,
the famous clock, which can be heard all over the world on the BBC.
If the _Houses of Parliament_ had not been _burn_ down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected.
Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall,who was responsible for the making of the clock,when the new Houses of Parliament were being built.
It is not only of _immense size_ ,but it's  _extremly accurate_ as well. 
_Officials from Greenwich observatory_ have the clock checked twice a day.
On the BBC,you can hear the clock when it is actually striking ,because microphones are connected to the clock tower.
Big Ben has rarely gone wrong.
Once, however,it failed to give the correct time.
A painter who had been working on the tower,hung a _pot_ of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down.`
