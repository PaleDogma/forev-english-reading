## 课文原文

Lesson Fifty-six Faster than **sound**

How fast did the winning car go?

Once a year,a race is held for old cars.
A lot of cars entered for this race last year, and there was a great _deal_ of excitement just **before** it began.
One of the most handsome cars was a _Rolls-Royce **Silver** Ghost_.
The most unusual car was a _Benz_, which had only three wheels.
Built in 1885,it was  the oldest car taking part.
After a great many  loud **explosions**, the race began.
Many of the cars broke down on the course, and some drivers spent more time **under** their cars than in them.
A few cars, however, _completed_ the race. 
The winning car reached the speed of forty miles an hour ,much faster than any of its rivals.
_It sped downhill at _ the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it.
The race gave everyone a great deal of **pleasure**.
It was very different from modern car races, but no less exciting.
