Lesson Eighty-two Monster or fish

What was the moster called?

Fishermen and sailors sometimes claimed\ to had seen monsters in the sea.
Though people have often laughed at the storied told by _seamen_ ,it is now known that many of these monsters which _have at times been sighted_ are  simply strange fish.
Ocasionally, unusual creatures are washed to shore,but they are rare caught out the sea.
Some time ago, howerver, a _peculiar_ fish was caught out _Madagascar_.
A small fishing boat was carried miles out to the sea  by the powerful fish  as it pulled on the line,.
Relizing that this was  not  ordinary  fish,the fishman made every effort not to damage it in any way
When it was eventually brought to shore,it was found to be over thirteen feet long.
It had a head like a horse,big blue eyes, shining _silver_ skin  and a bright tail.
This fish which has since been set to a museum  where it is being examined   by a scientist ,it called  an oarfish.
 
Such cretures  have rarely been seen _alive_ by man  as they lived at the depth of six hundred feet.
