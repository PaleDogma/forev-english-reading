Lesson Eighty-six Out of control

What was the danger?

As the man tried to swing the speed boat round, the steering will came away in his hands.
He waved _desperately_  to his companion, who had been _waterskiing_ for the last fifteen minutes.
Both men had hardly time to realize what was happening,when they were thrown   violently  into the sea.
The speed boat had struck a buyi, but it continued to move  very quickly across the water.
Both men had just begun  to swim  towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay  that the speed boat was moving in a circle.
It now came straight towards them at tremdous speed.
In less than a minute, it roar  pass them  only a few feet away.
After it had passed,they swam on as quickly as they could,because they knew   that the boat would soon return.
They had just had enough time  to swim  out of danger, when the boat again   completed the circle.
On this occasion, however, it had slowed down considerably.
The petrol had nearly all been used out.
Before long, the noise drafted completely,and the boat began to drift gently  across the boat.
