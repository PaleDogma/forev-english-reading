Lesson Seventy-nine By air

Why did the plane turn back?

I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy.
My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays.
A flight attendant would take charge of me/, and I never had   an unpleasant experience.
I am  used to travelling  by air,and only  on one occasion,had I  ever  felt frightened.
After taking off, we were flying low  over the city and slowly gaining height,  when the plane suddenly  turned round and flew back to the airport.
While we were waiting to land,a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had  touched down.
Everybody on board was worried and we were  curious  to find out what had happened.
Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board.
The police had been told  that a bomb  had been planted  on the plane.
After we had landed,the plane was searched thoroughly.
Fortunately nothing was found, and five hours later, we were able to take off again.
