Lesson Sixty  The future

Does what Madam Bellinsky said come true?

At a village fair, I decided to visit a fortune teller called Madam Bellinsky.
I went into her tent and she told me to sit down.
After I had given her some money, she looked into a crystal ball and said,
"A relation of yours is coming to see you,she will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days."
"The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise."
"A woman you know well,will rush towards you."
"She will speak to you,and then she will lead you away from this place."
"That is all."
As soon as I went outside/,I  forgot all about Madam Bellinsky,because my wife hurried towards me.
"Where have you been hidding\ ?"She asked _impatiently_.
"Your sister will be here in _less than an hour_,and we must be at the station to meet her.We are late already."
As she walked away,I followed her out of the fair.
