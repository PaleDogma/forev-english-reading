Lesson Sixty-one Trouble with the Hubble

What is the speical importance of the telescope in space?

The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April _twentieth_ nineteen-ninety,_at a cost_ of over a billion dollars.
Right from the start, there was trouble with the Hubble.
The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was _faulty_.

NASA is now going to put the telescope right\,so it will soon  be sending up  four astronauts to repair it.
The shuttle "Endeavor" will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble.
A robot-arm from the "Endeavor" will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs.

Of course/ ,the Hubble is _above_ the earth's  atmosphere,so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and _distant_ galaxies that we have ever seen.
The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age  and size  of the universe.
By the time/  you read this\,the Hubble's eagle eye will have  sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.
