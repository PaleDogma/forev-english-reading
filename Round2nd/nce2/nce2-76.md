Lesson Seventy-Six April Fools Day

What/  was\  the joke?

"To _end_ our special news bulletin,"said the voice of the television announcer, "we're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria." 
Macaroni has been grown in this area  for over six hundred years.

Two of the leading growers,Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante tell me that they have been expecting a _splendid_ crop this year and harvesting has began earlier than usual.  
Here you can see  two workers who   between them, have just finished cutting three _cartloads_ of golden brown macaroni _stalks_.
The whole village has been working day and night,gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September _rains_.
On the right/,you can see Mrs Brabante herself. 
She has been helping her husband for thirty years now/.
Mrs Brabante is talking to the manager   of the local factory,where the crop was processed.

This last scene/  shows you   what will happen at the \\end of the harvest.
The famous  Calabrian  macaroni  eating  competition.
Signor Fratelli,the present champion/  has won it every years since 1991.
And that _ends_ our special bulletin for today, /Thursday\, April 1st.
We're now   going back   to the studio.
