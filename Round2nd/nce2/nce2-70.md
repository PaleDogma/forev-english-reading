Lesson Seventy Red for danger

How was the drunk removed from the ring?

During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring.
The crowd began to shout but the drunk was unawared of the danger.
The bull was busy with matador at the time, but it suddenly caught sight of the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.
_Aparently sensitive to the criticism_,the bull forgot all about the matador and charged at the drunk.
The crowd suddenly grew quiet, the drunk,however, seemed quite sure of himself.
When the bull got close to him, he _clumsily_ steped aside to let it pass.
The crowd broke into cheers and the drunk bowed.
By this time,however, three men had come into the ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety.
Even the bull seemed feel sorry for him, for it looked _on_ sympathetically until the drunk was out of the way  before once _more turning_ its attention to the matador.
