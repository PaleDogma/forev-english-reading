Lesson Sixty-eight  Persistent

Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?

I crossed the street to avoid meeting him,but he saw me and came running towards me.
It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him.
I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes.
He never has anything to do.
No matter how busy you are,he always insists on coming with you.
I had to think of a way in preventing him from following me _around_ all morning.
"Hello! Nigel" I said,"Fancy meeting you here"
"Hi, Elizabeth" Nigel answered.
"I was just wandering how to spend the morning until _I saw_ you. 
You are not busy doing anything, are you?"
"No, not at all," I answered, "I'm going to "
"Would you mind my coming with you?"He asked  before I had finished speaking.
"Not at all!" I lied, "but I'm going to the dentist."
"That I'll coming with you." He answered, "There's always plenty to _read_   in the waiting room."
