Lesson Fifty-five Not a gold mine

What did the team find?

Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently.
A new machine called "The Revealer" has been invented and it has been used to **detect** gold which has been buried in the ground.
The machine was used in a cave near the sea shore where --it is said-- pirates used to hide gold.
The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to _collect it_.
Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.
The leader of the party was **examining** the soil near the _entrance_ to the cave, when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground. 
Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep.
They finally _found a_ small gold coin which was almost worthless.
The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly,but did not find anything except an empty tin _trunk_.
In spite of this, many people are confident that "the Revealer" _**may** reveal _ something of value fairly  soon.
