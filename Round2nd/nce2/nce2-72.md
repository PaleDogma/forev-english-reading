Lesson Seventy-two A Car called Blue Bird

What mistake was made?

The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell was the first man to drive at over three hundred miles per hour.
He set up a new world record in September 1935 at _Bonneville Salt Flats,Utah.
Bluebird\ , the car he was driving,had been specially bulit for him.
It was over 30 _feet in length_ and had a 2500 horse-power engine.
Although Campbell reached a  speed of over 304 miles per hour.
He had a great difficulty in controling the car because a  _tyre_ burst during the first _run_.
After his _attempt/ _,Campbell was disappointed to learn that  his average speed had been 299  miles per hour.
However,a few days later, he was told that a mistake\ had been made.
His average speed had been 301 miles per hour.
Since that time, racing drivers have reached the speeds over six hundred miles an hour.
Following in his father's footsteps    many years later, Sir Malcolm's son, Donald   also set up  a world record.
Like his father, he was driving a car called Bluebird.
