Lesson Seventy-five SOS

How did the woman get help?

When a _light_ passenger plane flew off course some time ago.
It crashed in the mountains, and its pilot was killed.
The only passengers,a young woman and her two baby daughters were unhurt.

It was the middle of winter,snow lay\  thick\ on the ground.
The woman knew/  that the nearest village was /miles\ away.
When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find.
During the night ,it got terribly cold.
The woman _kept_ as near as she could to the chidren and even tried to get into the case herself.
But it was too small.

Early next morning,she heard planes passing over head, and wondered how  she could send a signal.
Then she had an idea, she _stamped out the letters_ "SOS" in the snow. 
Fortunately, a pilot saw this signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.
It was not long before a helicopter arrived\  on the scene\  to resuce the survivors of the plane crash.
