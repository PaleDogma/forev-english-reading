Lesson Fifty-nine  In or out

Why did Rex run away?

Our dog,Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and bark.
Everytime he wanted to come in the garden,he will bark until someone opens the gate.
As the neighbours complaint of the noise,my husband spent weeks training him to _press _ his paw on the latch to let himself in.
Rex soon became an expert at openning the gate.
However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate.
This time,he was barking so that someone will let him out.
Since then, he has developed another bad habit.
As soon as he opens the gate from the outside,he comes into the garden and _waits until_ the gate shuts.
Then he _sits and barks until_ someone let him out.
After this,he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again.
Yesterday, my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed,we have never seen him since.
