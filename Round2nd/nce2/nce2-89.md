Lesson Eighty-nine A slip of the tongue--

Who made the only funny joke   that evening, and why?

People will do anything to see a free show, \\even  if it is a bad one.
When the news got _round_ that _a comedy_ show would be presented   at our local cinema   by the P and U Birds _Seed Company_.
We all rushed to see it.
We had to _queue for hours_ to get in,and there must have been  servel hundred people _present_    just before the show began. 
Unfortunately,the show was one of  the _dullest_ we have ever seen.
Those _who_ failed to get in   _need not  have felt disappointed_, as many of the artists _who_ should have appeard did not come. 
The only funny things we heard that evening,came from the _advertiser_ at the beginning of _programme_.
He was _obviously_ very nervous and for _some minutes_ stood _awkwardly_ before the microphone.
As soon as he open his mouth,everyone burst out laughing.
We all know what the poor man should have said,but what he actually said was:
"This is the _Poo_ and _Ee Seed Bird_ company ,good ladies,evening and gentlemen."
