Lesson Sixty-nine But not murder

Do you think that the writer passed/  his driving test? Why?

I was being tested for a driving license for the third time.
I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so/  successfully.
After having _been instructed_ to drive out of town,I began to acquire confidence.
Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test/.
The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he smiled and said "Just one more thing,Mr Eames."
"Let us suppose that a child/  suddenly\  crossed the road/  in front of you."
"As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop\  within five feet."
I continued driving  after some time/  the examiner tapped\ loudly/.
Though the sound could be heard clearly,it took me a long time to react.
I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.
The examiner looked at me sadly,
"Mr Eames",he said in a _mournful voice_, "You have just killed that child."
