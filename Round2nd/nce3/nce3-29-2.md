Lesson Twenty-nine/   Funny or not

What is the basis   of _sick_ humor?

A man who had broken his right leg,was taken to hospital,a few weeks before Christmas.
From the moment he arrived there,he kept on _pestering_ his doctor/   to tell him   when he would be able to go home. 
He _dreaded_ having to spend Christmas in hospital.
Though the doctor did his best/,the patient's _recovery_ was slow. 
On Christmas Day\ ,the man still had his right leg in _plaster_.
He spent _a_ _miserable_ day  in bed~, thinking _of all_ the fun\  he was missing.
The following day,however,the doctor _consulted_ him by telling him that his chances _of_ being able to leave the hospital  in /time  for New Year celebrations   were  good.
The man _took_ _heart_\,and sure enough/  on New Years' eve,he was able to _hobble along_   to a party. 
To compensate for his unpleasant experiences  in hospital,the man drank a little more   than was good for him.
In the process,he enjoyed himself thoroughly,and _kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals._
He was still _mumbling_ somthing about hospitals,at the end of the party,when he sliped   on a piece of _ice_   and broke his left leg.
