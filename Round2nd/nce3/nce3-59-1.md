Lesson Fifty-nine   Part one  Collecting 

What in particular does a _person gain_ when he or she becomes a serious collector?

People tend to _amass possessions_, sometimes without being aware of doing so.
Indeed, they can _have_ a _delightful_ surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.
_Those who_  never have to move house become _indiscriminate_ collectors of what can only be described _as clutter_.
They _leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics_ for years, in the believe that _they_ may one day need just those very things.
As they grow old, people also accumlate belongings for two other reasons, _lack of physical and mental energy,_ _both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away_ and _sentiment_.
_Things owned for a long time are full of associations_ with the past, perhaps with _relatives_ who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.
