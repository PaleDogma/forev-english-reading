Lesson Fifty-four   Part Three   Instinct or _Cleverness_

Was the writer successful in protecting his peach tree,why not?

They were _visited_ by a large colony of ants,which _obtained_ a sort of honey from them.
I immediately embarked an experiment which,even though it failed to get rid of the ants,_kept_ me fancinated for twenty-four hours.
I _bound_ the base of the tree with sticky _tape_,making it impossible for the ants to reach the _aphids_.
The _tape_ was so sticky that they did not dare to cross it.
For a long time,I watched them _scurrying_ around the base of the tree in bewilderment.
I even went out at the midnight with a torch,and noticed with _satisfaction_ and surprise that the ants were still swarming around the sticky _tape_,without being able to do anything about it. 
I got up next morning,hoping to find that the ants had given up in _despair_.
Instead, I saw they had discovered a new route.
They were climbing up the _wall_ of the house,and then onto the leaves of the tree.
I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their _ingenuity_.
The ants had been quicked to find the answer to my thoroughly unscientific _methods_.
