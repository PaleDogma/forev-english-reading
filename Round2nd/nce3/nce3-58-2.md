Lesson Fifty-eight   Part One  A spot of bother 

What did the old lady find when she got home?

Her first impulse was to go around all the rooms, looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. 
By this time her legs were _beginning_ to tremble, so she sat down and _accepted_ a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police.
Then, her _composure_ regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for any intruders who might still be _lurking_ in her flat. 
They went through the rooms being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to _hinder_ the police in their search for fingerprints.
The _chaos_ was _inconceivable_.
She had lived in the flat for thirty years, and _was a veritable magpie at hoarding_, and it seemed _as though_ everything she possessed had been _tossed_ out and turned over and over.
At least sorting out the things she should have _discarded_ years ago was now being made easier for her.
