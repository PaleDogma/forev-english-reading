Lesson Forty-five  The power of press

Does the writer think the parents were lucky or unlucky to gain _prosperity_ in this way,why?

In democratic countries,any efforts to restrict the freedom of the press are rightly _condemned_.
However this freedom can easily be abused.
Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events.
Though we may enjoy reading the lives about life of others,it is extremly doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves.
Acting on the _contention_ that facts are _sacred_.Reporters can cause untold suffering to _individuals_ by publishing details about their private lives.
Newspaepers exert such tremedous influence that they can not only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people,but can even overthrow a goverment.
The story of a poor family that acquired _fame_ and fortune overnight,dramatically illustrates the power of the press.
The family lived in _Aberdeen_, a small town of 23,000 _inhabitants_ in south _Dakota_.
As the parents had five children,life was a _perpetual_ struggle aganist _poverty_.
They were expecting their sixth child,and were faced with more pressing ecomonic problems.
If they had only had one more child,the fact would have passed unnoticed.
They would have continued to struggle against _economic odds_,and would have lived in  _obscurity_.
