Lesson Thirteen It's only me

What did the man expect to find _under_ the stairs? 

After her husband had gone to work,Mrs Richards sent her children to school, and went upstairs to her bedroom.
She was too excited to do any housework //that morning,for in the evening,she would be going to a fancy-dress party with her husband.
She intended to dress up as a ghost,and as she had made her _costume_ the night before,she _was impatient_ to try it on.
Though the _costume_ consisted only of _a_ _sheet_,it was very _effective_.
After _putting_ it on,Mrs Richards went down stairs.
She wanted to find out _whether_ it would be comfortable to wear.
 
---
Just as Mrs Richards was entering the dinning room, there was a knock on the front door.
She knew that it must be the _baker_.
She had told him to come _straight in_ if ever she _failed_ to open the door,and to leave the _bread_ on the _kitchen_ table.
Not wanting to frighten the poor man,Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small _storeroom_ under the stairs.
She heard the front door open and heave footsteps in the hall.
Suddenly the door of the _storeroom_ was open and a man entered.
Mrs Richards realized that it must be the man from the _Electricity Board_ who had come to _read the meter_.
She tried to explain the _situation_ _saying_,"it's only me.", but it was too late.
The man _let out of a cry_ and jumped back several _paces_.
When Mrs Richards walked towards him,he _fled_, _slamming_ the door behind him.
