Lesson One  A puma at large

Where must the puma have come from?

Wherever it went,it left behind it a _trail_ of dead deer and small animals,like rabbits.
_Paw prints_ were seen in a number of places   and puma fur was found _clinging_ to bushes.
Several people complained of   cat-like _noises_  at night,and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma   up a tree.
The experts were now, _fully_ _convinced_ that the animal   was a puma,but where had it come from?
As no puma had been reported missing from any zoo in the country,this one must have been in the possession of a private collector ,and somehow managed   to escape.
The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma  was not  caught.
It is disturbing   to think that a dangerous wild animal  is still at large  in the quiet countryside.
