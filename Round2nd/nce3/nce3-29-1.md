Lesson Twenty-nine/   Funny or not

What is the basis   of _sick_ humor?

Whether we find a joke funny or /not   largely /depends on  where we have been brought up\ .
The sense of humor is mysteriously _bound_ up\    with _national_ characteristics.
A frechman,for instance,might find it hard to laugh   at a Russian joke\ .
In the same way\ ,a Russian might fail to  see anything amusing  in a /joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.
Most funny stories are based on _comic_ situations.
In spite of national differences,certain funny situations  have a universal  _appeal_.
No matter where you live/ ,you would find it difficult not to laugh at ,_say_, Charlie Chanplin's early films.
However,a new type of humor,which stems largely from the US, has recently _come_ into fashion. 
It is called,"_sick_ humor".
_Comedians_ base their jokes on tragic situations, like  _violent_ _death_  or serious accidents.
Many people find   this sort of /joke _distasteful_.
The following example/  of sick humor, will enable you  to judge for yourself.
