Lesson Sixty  Part One  Too early and too late

Why did the young girl miss the train?

_Punctuality_ is a neccessary habit in all public _affairs_ in _civilized_ society.
Without it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion, everything would be in a state of chaos.
Only in a sparsely populated rural community, it is possible to disregard it.
In ordinary living, there can be some _tolerance_ of unpunctuality.
The _inteluctual_ who is working on some _abstruse_ problem, has everything _coordinated_ and organized, for the matter in hand.
He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party.
But people are often reproached for unpunctuality, when their fault is cutting things fine.
It is hard for an energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they are often _tempted_ to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment.
If no accidents occur on the way, like _punctured tyres_, _diversions_ of traffic, sudden _descent_ of fog, they will be on time.
