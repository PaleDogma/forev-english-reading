Lesson Fifty-seven   Part One  Back in the old country

Did the _narrator_ find his mother's grave?

I stopped to let the car _cool off_ and to study the map.
I had expected to be near my objective by now, but everything still seemed _alien_ to me.
I was only five when my father had taken me _abroad_, and that was eighteen years ago.
When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and _loneliness_.
Everything around him was full of her presense, continually reopening the wound, so he decided to _emigrate_.
In the new country,he became _obsorbed_ in making a new life _for the_ two of us,so that he gradually ceased the _grieve_.
He did not married again, and I was brought up without a woman's care, but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me.
