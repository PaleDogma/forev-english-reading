Lesson Fifty-six   Part Three   Our neighbour,the river

Why had the neighbours left their farm?

From an _attic_ window, we could get a _sweeping_ view of the river where their land _joined_ ours, and at the most _critical_ _juncture_, we took turns in watching that point. 
The first _sign_ of disaster was a dead sheep floating down.
Next came a horse, swimming _bravely_, but we were afraid that the _strength of_ current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted.
Suddenly, a _raft_ appeared, _looking rather like Noah's ark_, carring the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, a cat, and a _bird_ in the _cage_.
We realized that they must had become _unduly_ frightened, by the _rising_ flood, for their house which had _sound_ foundations would had stood _stoutly_  even if it had been almost submerged.
The men of our family _waded_ down through our _flooded_ _meadows_ with _boathooks_ in the hope of being able to _grapple_ a _corner_ of the raft, and _pull it_ out of the _current_ towards our bank.
We still think it _miracle_ that they were able to do so.
