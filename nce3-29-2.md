Lesson Twenty-nine/   Funny or not

What is the basis   of _sick_ humor?

Whether we find a joke funny or /not   largely /depends on  where we have been brought up\ .
The sense of humor is mysteriously _bound_ up\    with _national_ characteristics.
A frechman,for instance,might find it hard to laugh   at a Russian joke\ .
In the same way\ ,a Russian might fail to  see anything amusing  in a /joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.
Most funny stories are based on _comic_ situations.
In spite of national differences,certain funny situations  have a universal  _appeal_.
No matter where you live/ ,you would find it difficult not to laugh at ,_say_, Charlie Chanplin's early films.
However,a new type of humor,which stems largely from the US, has recently _come_ into fashion. 
It is called,"_sick_ humor".
_Comedians_ base their jokes on tragic situations, like  _violent_ _death_  or serious accidents.
Many people find   this sort of /joke _distasteful_.
The following example/  of sick humor, will enable you  to judge for yourself. 

---

A man who had broken his right leg,was taken to hospital,a few weeks before Christmas.
From the moment he arrived there,he kept on _pestering_ his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home. 
He _dreaded_ having to spend Christmas in hospital.
Though the doctor did his best,the patient's _recovery_ was slow. 
On Christmas Day,the man still had his right leg in _plaster_.
He spent _a_ _miserable_ day  in bed, thinking _of all_ the fun he was missing.
The following day,however,the doctor _consulted_ him by telling him that his chances _of_ being able to leave the hospital in time for New Year celebration were good.
The man _took_ _heart_,and sure enough on New Years' eve,he was able to _hobble along_ to a party. 
To compensate for his unpleasant on Christmas,the man drank a little more than was good for him.
In the process,he enjoyed himself thoroughly,and _kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals._
He was still _mumbling_ somthing about hospital,at the end of the party,when he sliped on a piece of _ice_ and broke his left leg.
