Lesson Forty-Six   Part One   Do it Yourself

Did the writer repair his _lawn_ _mower_ in the end,why? why not?

So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves,that we are becoming _increasing_ less _dependent_ on specalized labor.
No one can _plead_ _ignorance_ of a _subject_ any longer,for there are _countless_ "do it yourself" _publications_.
Armed with the right tools and materials,_newlyweds_ _gaily_ _embark_ on the task of decorating their own homes.
Men,particularly,spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces,laying out their own gardens,buiding garages and making funiture.
Some,really _keen_ _enthusiasts_,go so far as to build their own computers.
Shops _cater_ for the do-it-youself craze,not only by running special _advisory services_ for _novices_,but by offering consumers _bits_ and pieces which they can assemble at home.
Such things _provide an_ excellent _outlet_ for _pent up_ _creative_ energy ,but unfornately not all of us are _born handymen_. 
Some wives tend to believe that their husbands are _infinitely_ _resourceful_,and can fix anything.
