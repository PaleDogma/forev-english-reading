Lesson one  Part Two  Finding fossil man 

Why are _legends_ _handed_ down by storytellers useful?

But the first people like ourselves lived so long ago, that even their sagas,if they had _any_, are forgotten. 
So _archaeologists_ have _neither_ history nor legends to help them to find out where the first modern men came from.
Fortunately, however, accient men made tools of stone, especially _flint_,because this is easier to _shape_ than other kinds.
They may also have used wood and skins, but these have _rotted_ away.
Stone does not _decay_, and so the tools of long ago have remained, when even bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.
