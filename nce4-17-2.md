Lesson Seventeen  Part two  A man-made disease

What factor _helped spread_ the disease of _myxomatosis_ ?

There _were_ hopes, however, that the problem of rabbit would be managable.
_Ironically_, Europe， which had _been bequeathed the rabbit as a _pest_ to Australia, _acquired_ this man-made disease as a _pestlence_.
A french _physician_ decided to get rid of the wild rabbits in its own estate, and intruduced myxomatosis.
It did not, however, remain within the confines _of_ his estate.
It spread through France where wild rabbits are not generally regarded as _a_ pest, but as _a_ sport, and _a useful_ food supply, and it spread to Britain where wild rabbits are regarded as pest, but where _domesticated_ rabbits equally susceptable to the disease, are the basis _of_ _profitable_ fur industry.
The question became one of whether Man could control the disease he had invented.

Richard Cord, Science makes sense.
