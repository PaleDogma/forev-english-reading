Lesson Sixty  Part Three  Too early and too late

Why did the young girl miss the train?

And even the harder situation, it's to be on the platform in good time for a train , and still to see it go off without you.
Such an experience _befell_ a certain young girl, the first time she was travelling alone.
She entered the station twenty minutes before the train was _due_, since her parents had _impressed_ upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and caused the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her.
She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket.
To her _horror_, he said she was two hours too soon.
She _felt in_ her hand bag for the _piece of_ paper, on which her father had written _down_ all the details of the journey, and gave it to the porter.
He agreed, that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper, and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passagers.

## 自我总结
* 外国的火车票上只有的车次和目的地吗？为什么拿到票了都不知道时间，为什么porter看到票后说她早到了2个小时。难道是流水车，只要有票并且目的地一致，一个时间区间内随便坐。
