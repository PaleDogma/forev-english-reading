Lesson Fifty-nine   Part one  Collecting 

What in particular does a _person gain_ when he or she became a serious collecor?

Whatever it consists of, stamps, wrecks, first editions of books, china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, staff _birds_, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place in the lady's dition   to varal finding facts in the reference book.
This hobby _ejects_ one not only in the _qiuson_ subject, but also in _general matters_ which have some bearing on it. 
There are also other _benefits_.
_One wants to meet likeminded collectors , to get advise, to compare knows, to exchange antiques, to show off the latest find._
So one circle a friends groups.
_Soon the hobby leads to trouble, perhaps do a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad_ in search of a rare spciman, for collectors are not confined in anyone country.
Over the years, one might well become  _sority_  on  one's hobby, and will very popular be asked to give an informal talks to little gatherings, then if successful, to larger _ordiansis_.
In this way,self-confidence grows, first from _mastryring_  a subject, then from being talking about it.
Collecting,_by occuping spare time so constrictly_ makes people contented, with no time _for bother_ them.
