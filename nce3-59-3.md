Lesson Fifty-nine   Part one  Collecting 

What in particular does a _person gain_ when he or she became a serious collecor?

People tend to _amassamass_, sometimes without being aware of doing so.
Indeed, they can _have_ _delightful_ surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned.
_Those who_  never have to move house become _indiscriminate_ collectors, of what can only be described _as clutter_.
They _leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics_ for years, in the believe that _they_ may one day need just those very thing.
As they grow old, people also accumlate belongings for two other reasons, _lack of physical and mental energy,_ _both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away_ and _sentiment_.
_Things owned for a long time are full of associations_ with the past, perhaps with _relatives_ who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.

Some things are collected deliberately in the home, in an attempt to avoid waste.
_Among these,_ I would list _string_ _and_ brown paper,kept by thrift people when a parcel has been open,to save buying these two _requisites_.
Colleting small _items_ can easily became a mania.
I know someone who always _cut sketches out from_ newspapers of model _cloth_ that she would love to buy if she had the money. 
As she is not rich, the _chances_ that she will be ever able to afford such purchases are remote, but she is never _sufficiently_ strong minded to be able to stop the practice.
It is a harmless habit, but litters up her desk to such an extent, that every time she opens _it_, _loose_ bits and paper fall out in every derection.  
Collecting as a serious _hobby_ is quiet different, and has many adventages.
It provides _relaxation_ for leisure hours, as just looking at ones _treasures_ these always _a joy_
_One does_ not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.

Whatever it consists of, stamps, wrecks, first editions of books, china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, staff _birds_, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place in the lady's dition   to varal finding facts in the reference book.
This hobby _ejects_ one not only in the _qiuson_ subject, but also in _general matters_ which have some bearing on it. 
There are also other _benefits_.
_One wants to meet likeminded collectors , to get advise, to compare knows, to exchange antiques, to show off the latest find._
So one circle a friends groups.

_Soon the hobby leads to trouble, perhaps do a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad_ in search of a rare spciman, for collectors are not confined in anyone country.
Over the years, one might well become  _sority_  on  one's hobby, and will very popular be asked to give an informal talks to little gatherings, then if successful, to larger _ordiansis_.
In this way,self-confidence grows, first from _mastryring_  a subject, then from being talking about it.
Collecting,_by occuping spare time so constrictly_ makes people contented, with no time _for bother_ them.
