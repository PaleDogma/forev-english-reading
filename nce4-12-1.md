Lesson Twelve   Part One  Banks and their customers

Why is there no _risk_ to the customer when _a_ bank prints the customer's name on his cheques?

When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money, repayment of which, he may demand at anytime, either in cash, or by drawing a cheque in favor of another person. 
_Primarily_, the banker-customer relationship is that of _debtor_ and _creditor_, who is which depending on whether the customer's account _is in credit_ or is _overdrawn_.
But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another.
Many of these obligations can give _rise_ to  problems and complications, but a bank customer unlike, say, _a buyer of_ goods, can not complain _that the law is loaded_ against him.
