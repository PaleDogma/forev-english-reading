Lesson Three  Part Two _Matterhorn_ Man

What was the main objective of early mountain climbers?

It is hard for us to realize nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers. 
Except for one or two places, such as _Zermatt_, and _Chamonix_, which had rapidly become popular.
_Alpine_ villages _tended to be impoverished settlements_ cut off from the civilization by the high mountains.
Such inns _as there were_ _were_ generally dirty and _flea-ridden_,the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread, often twelve months old, all washed down with _coarse_ wine. 
Often a valley _boasted no inn at all_, and climbers find shelter wherever they could ,sometimes with the local _priest_ who _was usually as poor as his parishioners_, sometimes with _shepherds_ or cheese makers.
Invariably, the background was the same, dirt and _poverty_ and very uncomfortable.
For men _accustomed_ to eating _seven course_ dinners and sleeping between five _linen_ sheets at home, the change to the _Alps_, must have been very hard indedd.
