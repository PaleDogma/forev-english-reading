Lesson Twenty  Part one  Snake poison

What are the two differnt ways in which snake posion acts?

How it came about the snakes manufactured poison is a mystery.
Over the periods, their _saliva, a _mild, digestive juice_ like our own, was converted into a posion that _defies_ analysis even today.
It was not _forced upon_ them, by the _survival_ _competition_, they could _caught and lived on_ pray without using posion, just as thousands of non-poison snakes still do.
Posion to a snake is _merely_ a _luxury_ ,_it enables it_ to get its food with very little _effort_, not _more_ _effort_ than, one bite.
And why only snakes?
Cats, for an instance, would be greatly helped, not running _fights_ with _large_ _fierce_ rats or _tussles_ with _grown_ rabbits, just a bite, and not more _effort_ needed.

In fact, it _would_ be an assistance to all _carnivores_, though it would be _two-edged_ weapon when they _fought_ each other.
But _of_ the _vertebrates_, _unpredictable_ nature selected only snakes, and one _lizard_.
One wonders also why nature, _with_ some snakes _concoted poison_ of such an extreme potency.
In the _conversion_ of _saliva_ _into_ poison, one may supposed _a fixed process_ _took  place_ , it did not.
