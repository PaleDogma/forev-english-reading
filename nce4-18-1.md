Lesson Eighteen  Part one  porpoises

What would you _say is the main _characteristic_ of porpoises?

There has long been a superstition among _mariners_  that porposes will save _drowning_ men by pushing them to the surface, or protect them from sharks by surrouding them  in a defensive formation.
Marine Studio _biologists_ had _pointed out_ that, however intelligent they may be, it is probably a mistake to _credit_ dolphins with any _motive_ of life saving.
On the occasion when they have pushed ashore _an unconscious human being_ ,they _have much more_ likely done it out of curiosity, or for a sport, as _in riding the bow_ wave of a ship.


In 1928, some porpoises  was photographed working like _beavers_ to push ashore, a _waterlogged_ _mattress_.
If as has been reported, they had protected human beings from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them, and because the scent of a possible meal attracted sharks.
