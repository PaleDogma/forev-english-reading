Lesson Fifty-eight   Part One  A spot of bother 

What did the old lady find when she got home?

Then the police inspector arrived with a _constable_ and she told them of her discovery of the _ransacked_ flat.
The inspcetor began to look for fingerprints while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been fored, _thereby_ proving that the burglar had either used _skeleton_ keys, or  entered over the balcony.
There were not trace of fingerprints, but the inspetor found a dirty red _buddle_ that contained a jewellery which the old lady said was not hers.
So they _entry_ into the flat was _apparently_ not the burglar's first job that day, and they must _invent_ to _disturbed_.
The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what were missing by the next day,and advised her to stayalone in the flat for a few nights.
They old lady thougt he was _fussy_ _creature_, but _since_ the porter agreed with him, she _rang up_ her _daughter_ and asked for her help, and what she dedcribed as a litte spot of bother.
