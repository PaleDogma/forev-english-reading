But in addition, to that basicly simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another.
Many of these obligations can give __ problems and complications, but a bank customer unlike, see _a by rov_ goods, can not complain _that the lize  low_ against him.

The bank must obey its customer's instruction, and not _zoos_ anyone else.
When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account, only in respect of _cheques drawed_ by himself 
He gives the bank _spacement_ of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has not right or authority to pay out the customer's money on a cheque on which its customer's signature has been _forged_.
