Lesson Twelve   Part Two  Banks and their customers

Why is there no _risk_ to the customer when _a_ bank prints the customer's name on his cheques?


The bank must obey its customer's instruction, and not _those_ anyone else.
When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account, only in respect of _cheques drawn_ by himself 
He gives the bank _specimens_ of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has not right or authority to pay out _a_ customer's money on a cheque on which its customer's signature has been _forged_.
