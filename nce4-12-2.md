Lesson Twelve   Part Two  Banks and their customers

Why is there no _risk_ to the customer when _a_ bank prints the customer's name on his cheques?


The bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not _those of_ anyone else.
When, for example, a customer first opens an account \, he instructs the bank to debit his account /, only in respect of _cheques drawn_ //  by himself 
He gives the bank _specimens_ of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has not right or authority to pay out _a_ customer's money on a cheque on which its customer's signature  has been _forged_.  

---

It makes no difference that _the_ forgery   may _have been_ a very skillful one, the bank must recognize its customer's signature.
For this reason, there is no risk to the customer in the _practice_, adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his cheques.
If this  _facilitates_ forgery, it is the bank\  which will lose/, not the customer \\.

Gorden Berry and Abellel Diement, the consumer's _society_ and the law.
