Lesson Eight Part Two Trading standards  


_Politicians_ agree in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test  many products
They hope to finish in time _for a trade summit_ between America and the EU on May 28th. 
Although _negotiators_ are _optimistic_, the details are complex enough, that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all.
Why, one difficulty is to _construct the agreements_.
The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devises and then _hammer out_ different _pacts_ covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing.
The EU, following fine _continental_ traditions, wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products, and perhaps extended to other countries.
