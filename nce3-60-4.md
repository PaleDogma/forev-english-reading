Lesson Sixty  Part Four  Too early and too late

Why did the young girl miss the train?

The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not make such a mistake.
The porter went to fetch one, and arrived back with the station master, he produced it with _a flourish_ , and pointed out a _microscopic_ 'O',beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station.
This little 'O' indicated that the train only stopped for mail.
Just at that monment, the train came into the station.
The girl tears _streaming_ _down_ her face, begged to be allowed to _slip_ into the guard's van. 
But the station master was _adamant_, rules could not be broken.
And she had to watch that train disappeared towards her destination, while she was left behind.
