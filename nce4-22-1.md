Lesson Twenty-two  Part one  Knowledge and _Progress_

In what two _areas_ had people made no progress at all?

Why does the idea of progress loom so large in the modern world?
_Surely_ because progress of a particular kind is actually taking place _aroud us_, and is becoming more and more _manifest_.
Although mankind _has_ _undergone_ no general improvement in _intelligence_ or _morality_, it _has_ made _extrordinary_ _progress_ in the _accumulation_ of knowledge.
Knowledge began to increase as soon as the _thoughts_ of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech
With _the_ invention of writing, a great _advance_ was made, for knowledge could _then be_ not only communicated, but also stored.
Libraries made _education_ possible, and education, in its _turn_, _added to libraries_, the _growth_ of knowledge followed a kind of _compound interst law_,  which was greatly _enhanced_ by the invention of printing.
All this was comparatively slow, until, with _the_  coming of science, the tempo was suddenly _raised_.
