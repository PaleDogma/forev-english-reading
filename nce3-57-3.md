Lesson Fifty-seven   Part Three  Back in the old country

Did the _narrator_ find his mother's grave?

_Well_ I had been wrong, for I was now lost.
I looked at the map and _then at_ the milometer
I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should  be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of _church_ of our village showing in the far distance.
I could see no valley, no farms, no cattages, and no church spire, only a lake.
I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere.  
So I drove back to the town, and began to _retrace_ the _route_,taking frequent glances on the map.
I landed up at the same corner.
