Lesson Forty-Six  Part Three   Do it Yourself

Do the writer repair his _lawn_ _mower_ in the end,why? why not?

_Inevitably_,the repair job was not quite so simple.
The mower _firmly_ refused to move,so I decided to _dismantle_ it.
The garden was soon _littered_ with _chunks_ of mental which had once made up a lawn mower.
But I was extremely pleased with myself,I have _traced_ the cause of the trouble.
One of the links in the chains that drives the wheels had _snapped_.
After buying a new chain,I was faced with the _insurmountable_ task of putting the confusing _jigsaw_ _puzzl_  together again.
I was not surprised to find that the machine still refuse to  work after I had reassemble it,for the simple reason,that I was left with several _curiously_ shaped of mental which did not seem to fit anywhere.
I gave up in despair.
The weeks passed at a _grass_ _grew_.
When my wife _nagged_ me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower,or let the grass _grow_.
Needless to say,our house is now surrounded by a jungle.
Buried somewhere in the deep grass there is a _rusting_ lawn mower which I had promised to repair one day.
