Lesson Fourteen Part one  The Butterfly Effect

Why do small _errors_ make it _impossible_ to predict the _weather system_ with a high degree of accuracy?

Suppose every sensor gives the perfectly accurate reading of temperature, _pressure_, humidity and any other quantity a _meteorologist_ would want.

---

Precisely, at _noon_, an infinitely powerful computer, takes all the data and _calculates_ _what will happen_ at each point, at 12:01, then 12:02, then 12:03.
The computer will still be unable to predict weather _Princeton, New Jersey_  will have a sun or rain on a day one month away.

At _noon_, the spaces between sensors will _hided_ fluctuations, that the computer will not know about, tiny deviation from the average.
By 12:01, those fluctuations will already have created small errors one foot way.
Soon the errors will have multiplied to ten foot scale, and so on up to the size of globe.

James Glik, Chaos
