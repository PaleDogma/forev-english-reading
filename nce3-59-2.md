Lesson Fifty-nine   Part Two  Collecting 

What in particular does a _person gain_ when he or she became a serious collecor?

Some things are collected deliberately in the home, in an attempt to avoid waste.
_Among these,_ I would list _string_ _and_ brown paper,kept by thrift people when a parcel has been open,to save buying these two _requisites_.
Colleting small _items_ can easily became a mania.
I know someone who always _cut sketches out from_ newspapers of model _cloth_ that she would love to buy if she had the money. 
As she is not rich, the _chances_ that she will be ever able to afford such purchases are remote, but she is never _sufficiently_ strong minded to be able to stop the practice.
It is a harmless habit, but litters up her desk to such an extent, that every time she opens _it_, _loose_ bits and paper fall out in every derection.  
Collecting as a serious _hobby_ is quiet different, and has many adventages.
It provides _relaxation_ for leisure hours, as just looking at ones _treasures_ these always _a joy_
_One does_ not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.
