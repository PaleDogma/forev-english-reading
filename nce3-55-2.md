Lesson Fifty-five   Part Two   From the earth: Greetings

Which life forms are most likely to develop on an _distant_ planet?

_Alternatively_ if the star was small,the life supporting planet would have to have a close _orbit_ around it and also provided the perfect conditions for life forms to develop.

But how would we find such a planet?
At present,there is not telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the _presence_ of life.
The development of such a telescope will be one of the great _astronomical_ projects of the 21 century.
It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-base telescopes.
Our own warm atmosphere _and_ the heat generated by the telescope would made it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. 
Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful _Hubble_ telescope, would not be suitable,because of the dust particles in our solar system.
