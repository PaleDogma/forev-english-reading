Lesson Nineteen  Part one  The stuff of dreams

What is going on when a person _experiences rapid eye-movements_ during sleep?

It is fairly clear that the sleeping _period_ must have some function, and because they are so much of it, the function would seem to be important.
_Speculations_ about its nature, having been going for literally thousands of years, and one _odd_ finding that makes the _problem_ _puzzling_ is that _it_ looks very much as _if_ sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest.
Rest, _in terms of muscle relaxition_ and so on, can be achieved by a breath _period lying_ or even sitting on.
The body's _tissues_ is self-repairing and _self_restoring_ to a degree, and function best when more or less _continuously active_.
In fact, the basic _amount of_ movement occurs during sleep, which is _specifically_ concerned with preventing muscle inactivity.
