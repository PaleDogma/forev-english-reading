How did Vera discover she had this gift of second sight ?

During these tests, she was able to read the newspaper through an opaque screen, and stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child's game of Lotto, she was able to describe the figures and colors printed on it.
And in another _instance_, wearing stockings and slippers to make out with her foot, the _outlines_ and colors of a picture ,hidden under a carpet.
Other experiments showed that her _knees_ and _shoulders_ had the similiar sensitivity. 
During all these tests, Vera was _blindfold_, and indeed, expect when blindfold she _lacked the ability_ to perceive things with her skins, it was also found that although she can perceive things with her fingers, this ability ceased the monment her hands were wet.
